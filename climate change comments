UgxMdRhqn32blHcGP_V4AaABAg	Deebz270	26 minutes ago	1536040688852	Well I have a big problem with this.  (Aside from having to retype this all out again, because either you Potholer54 or the YouTube robot, couldn't handle my response and consequently deleted my comment ! ).  . Firstly - Humankind and especially industrial civilisation is a heat engine.   All renewable technologies still require rare-earth metals, minerals and oil, so hardly carbon neutral, let alone 'sustainable'.   These technologies still require mining and will continue to cause habitat loss.  This is something I would have thought you'd know Peter, being an ex geologist.  . A 'free-market economy' - capitalsim, is precisely what this planet does not need, any more than it needs 195/6 nations all vying to attain the affluence of the western societies.  (I won't mention the religious impedences.... Or population overshoot).  . As for CO2 drawdown, well I shall await your Part Two, with bated breath.    . I may sound somewhat sardonic, for which I offer no apology.  I do still regard your work as highly important and applaud your endeavours to continue debunking the myths and illuminating the truth of science to the masses herein.   . I just wish you'd mention the herd of elephants in the room....	0	false	0

UgxVaMDfUpTv6KNwqIh4AaABAg	Jean-Pierre De Vent	43 minutes ago	1536039668880	Compressed air needs much suitable storage room but in the UK they liquefy now air and use the fast expansion later (with the help of available waste heat nearby) to drive a turbine. It seems obvious the efficiency is not superb although it can be improved with recycling cold and heat and you can built such a plant anywhere where there is waste heat and solar and wind are free anyway. Perhaps the emerging need for airco could mean the liquid air (or nitrogen) could be use more directly to cool buildings.	0	false	0

Ugxcj2fbT5NJgqLoN654AaABAg	BJ R	1 hour ago	1536038648948	I enjoyed this video, potholer, and I understand your ideological position, but I have to call you out on one thing. It's obvious that you haven't given "anti-capitalist environmentalism" (or eco-socialism) much thought. Your assertion that eco-socialists are a monolith of degrowthers and primitivists (i.e., they want to take us "back to 1850") is a blatant strawman. If you're interested in refining your view and actually confronting your ideological opponents, I recommend two eco-socialist thinkers: John Bellamy Foster and Andreas Malm.   And while I'm here: you've surprisingly left out nuclear energy in this whole equation. You'll cover it in a later episode, I hope. And furthermore, there are many eco-socialists who advocate nuclear energy, which is an extremely efficient and low-carbon energy source, in conjunction with other renewables.	0	false	0						
UgxBIjuFjSSMVY2GJKF4AaABAg	Deebz270	1 hour ago	1536038648952	All very well and good (or bad), but Potholer54 is overlooking the FACT, that human civilisation is a heat engine and that even new, renewable technologies require resources.  These technologies utilise rare-earth metals, oil and other minerals, all of which come from the ground and require mining.  So hardly carbon neutral and still depleting recources on a planet with finite resources.  As an ex geologist, you should know this Peter.   . A 'free-market economy' - capitalism, is exactly what this planet does not need, any more than it needs 195/6 countries all vying to become affluent 'westernised' societies.   And don't get me started on religion... Or population overshoot. . Right, now I'll check out your second post, especially that of CO2 drawdown..  This should be interesting.   Ahh...  But Part Two is not yet available...   I therefore await your next upload with bated breath. . I may be sounding somewhat sardonic Peter, for which I offer no appology.  However, I still recognise and totally applaud your endeavours to 'educate the masses', especially on debunking myths and on clarifying matters of science, but I do wish, you'd address the elephant in the room.

Ugy_ucx0KolPghMfG-l4AaABAg	Michael Rowan	2 hours ago	1536035050072	There is a CONSERVATIVE solution and it is not wind and solar. It's nuclear power.   Yes, renewables like wind, solar, and geothermal must be researched and developed. But they are NOT going to be able to make a difference in the time frame required to properly address climactic change. There are indeed times when wind energy is plentiful enough in Europe that utilities pay customers, but for every one of those times there is another where the output is insufficient and fossil fuels must be burned! This is the impetus for the disgraceful Nordstream 2 project. Good luck getting the share your energy output up over 50% from wind and solar, especially in Europe! To try at this juncture is just wheel spin. Only nuclear has the capacity factor and scalability in the near-term to FULLY support a viable carbon free economy. This is energy gifted to us by ancient supernovas, energy that is not used in any way in the surface ecology of this planet! It's just sitting there.   As an American who is conservative leaning, I can't stand seeing the issue of climate change being widely considered as "leftist" turf! This video does a great job showing how some conservative pundits, whom I normally enjoy, seem to turn into ideologues when it comes to climate change! Climate change is never an excuse for ushering in "globalism", which is all the more reason why the proponents of the free market can not let this issue remain the sole purview of the likes of China and the authoritarian Left. (What's more it seems China now has a lead in developing advanced nuclear, a field that WE pioneered.)  I'm interested potholer54 - what are your thoughts on how nuclear fits into possible climate change remedies? Will the next installment address this? All in all great video and thank you for the motivating kick in the rear!  https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2017/10/10/why-arent-renewables-decreasing-germanys-carbon-emissions/#5e2f46e68e15  http://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2017/1/13/breaking-german-emissions-increase-in-2016-for-second-year-in-a-row-due-to-nuclear-closure  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-essen-wingas/german-renewable-power-expansion-will-need-gas-as-back-up-wingas-idUSKBN1FP2HL  https://www.youtube.com/user/gordonmcdowell/featured?pbjreload=10	0	true	3						
								Ugy_ucx0KolPghMfG-l4AaABAg.8kl4kk2kiZd8kl7WdoOaTl	Dielfon Elletab	1 hour ago	1536038650862	I think that renewables have advanced sufficiently and are economically viable enough so nuclear isn't needed any more. Maybe 50 years ago if there was more investment into nuclear it would have been perfect, but renewables have caught up to and overtaken nuclear now.	0
								Ugy_ucx0KolPghMfG-l4AaABAg.8kl4kk2kiZd8klAQX2kX6S	jthadcast	1 hour ago	1536038650873	nothing wrong with any of those technologies but at scale production, they all become economic and environmental disasters because it takes too many resource and time to tweak or retrofit them in our current grid paradigm.  only the small english tokamak or minimum footprint lfter could be implemented before time runs out.  the answer is to turn our back on the consumerism and consumption methodology and go hyper-local, time to adapt or die.  mega production is a "profit for the owner" thing not a "profit for the planet" thing and Germany is failing on purpose, waste is profit.	0
								Ugy_ucx0KolPghMfG-l4AaABAg.8kl4kk2kiZd8klDByO3del	Michael Rowan	1 hour ago	1536038650877	Dielfton Elletab, I encourage you to have a look at the links I included, especially the gordonmcdowell YouTube channel. The only problem is that we stopped investing in nuclear. There are only four known fundamental forces of nature and the strong force is the most powerful of these. Nuclear power takes advantage of this force, so from a physics standpoint it's not going anywhere! It is just a matter of who implements it and how soon. Intermittent power sources are not suitable as the sole means of powering a society, considering that you have places like hospitals with their power hungry life support systems. Another problem with the sole use of renewables (among many) is the land use issue, which you don't have with nuclear. It's going to take a lot of space to replace all those MW's with wind and solar, because they are diffuse energy sources. Uranium and Thorium are thousands of times more energy dense. Wind will never catch up to nuclear. Solar might someday in the far future, but that would take opening up space travel in a MASSIVE way (i.e. solar satellites). Looking at the current state of our combined global space program we don't have the time to wait!	0

Ugyk5JnrUokEqXhYVrt4AaABAg	Pretty Pixie	2 hours ago	1536035050115	One thing you fail to highlight is the role of money in politics. Powerful interests in fossil fuels have a vested interest in keeping their competitors in renewables out of the market, and are well positioned to do so within the american political system. It doesn't take a lot of work to find that many politicians of both ends of the political spectrum get money from oil companies to protect their interests, stifling attempts to pass legislation for cleaner energy. The same money is behind disinformation campaigns to scare voters away from clean energy with the specter of higher taxes, like what happened in Australia. The prime goal of any company is profit, and fossil fuel industries will have to invest a lot of money (or even change their business altogether) to make sure they do what's necessary for a cleaner environment. And no shareholder is going to be happy with that. So yes, traditional capitalism is part of the problem.	0	false	0

You can be a geologist and also ignorant, logically flawed and cognitively biased to the point of delusional.  You've got an opinion? Have you ever looked up the definition of an opinion? Are you sure it's just an opinion?  I think you're manipulative piece of shit. You're using political identity labeling, high school debate team bullshit addiction, the trendy shit lording format and feigning humility while talking positively about having opinions which is all status quo driven retard Orchestra diarrhea of the mouth..  every last bit of it is for the purpose of manipulating people into paying attention to you.  Opinions are not necessarily based on evidence. A hypothesis is a starting point to ask questions, not a place where you propose that you know what you're talking about or that your thoughts have a lot of value.... Not very scientific of you at all to pretend to be humble or to pass off a hypothesis as valuable. as a matter of fact it's totally irresponsible and proves that you're actually a fucking idiot that's pretending to be a genius.  when you get to the point of a valuable Theory because you've actually done all the necessary evidence collection and evidence valuation then package it as such and publish that instead of wasting our time with this tripe.  a minute and 45 seconds in and I already know I'm wasting my time listening to another fucking word.  there's so much bullshit oversaturation in this market for our attention that I would be a fool to listen to someone who is either a manipulative piece of shit or a logically flawed, cognitively biased  guilt-ridden child.  Again, proving that there are no such thing as intelligent conservatives. I'm still correct in my understanding that anybody who subscribes to the political identity of a conservative and uses that label as a virtue signal is indeed borderline retarded.  I hope that you change into something that isn't whatever the fuck it is you're pretending to be right now. Get to work pussy.	0	true	3

That helped address the ozone depletion. See:  "The ozone story: A model for addressing climate change?" "Quantifying the ozone and ultraviolet benefits already achieved by the Montreal Protocol" "Evidence for the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer" "Depletion of the ozone layer in the 21st Century" "The Antarctic ozone hole: An update" "Antarctic ozone loss in 1979â€“2010: First sign of ozone recovery" "Emergence of healing in the Antarctic ozone layer" "Stratospheric temperature trends: Our evolving understanding", pages 599 and 600   2) Governments led the way on policies that helped address acid rain:  "From acid rain to climate change" "A fresh look at the benefits and costs of the US acid rain program"   3) Governments made laws limiting smoking in various places. Those laws resulted in heath benefits, though scientists with links to the tobacco industry try to obscure this point:  "Why review articles on the health effects of passive smoking reach different conclusions" "Effect of smoke-free legislation on perinatal and child health: a systematic review and meta-analysis" "Effect of tobacco control policies on perinatal and child health: a systematic review and meta-analysis" "Smoke-free legislation and hospitalizations for childhood asthma"   4) Government legislation on seat-belts help limit injuries and mortality from vehicle accidents:  "Effectiveness of primary enforcement safety belt laws and enhanced enforcement of safety belt laws: A summary of the Guide to Community Preventive Services systematic reviews" "Reviews of evidence regarding interventions to increase the use of safety belts" "Primary enforcement seat belt laws are effective even in the face of rising belt use rates" "Getting Americans to buckle up: The efficacy of state seat belt laws" "Estimating the impact of seat belt use on traffic fatalities: empirical evidence from Canada" "States with primary enforcement laws have lower fatality rates (updated)" "Reconsidering the effects of seat belt laws and their enforcement status" "Changing paradigms of seat belt and air bag injuries: what we have learned in the past 3 decades" "The effects of mandatory seat belt laws on driving behavior and traffic fatalities"   5) Governments made laws that assisted with the issue of leaded gasoline.

It's not hard to dispatch most of the lefts arguments. It's so easy in fact, that you can do it while tacking on your own intellectually bankrupt ideas such as "global warming is a hoax" or "society cannot reasonably exist without a retreat back into theism," seemingly without notice. In essence, the cognitive weakness of the left has allowed for slightly less cognitive weakness on the right. It's why both sides need true intellectuals, with thorough and consistent world-views so that they inspires the best ideas from both ends of the political spectrum.	0	true	1

No, it is, in the US. For example:   "Many conservative Republicans express doubts about whether the work of climate scientists is based on the best available evidence. Some 35% say scientistsâ€™ research findings on climate are not often or never influenced by the best available evidence. But only 14% of moderate and liberal Republicans and 8% of Democrats agree with this view. [...] Conservative Republicans are particularly likely to think research findings from climate scientists are influenced by the desire of scientists to advance their own careers and by their personal political leanings. About half or more of conservative Republicans say each of these two factors influences research findings most of the time. Minorities in the other party/ideology groups say either of these influence research findings most of the time." http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/04/conservative-republicans-especially-skeptical-of-climate-scientists-research-and-understanding/?

Here in Canada, your balanced perspective might be labelled "moderate", since our conservative parties at the federal and provincial levels are starting to emulate American populism. Traditional economic conservativism seems to be waning all over the place.  A solution to climate change is urgently needed which will address the physical problem (too much GHG in the sky, so essentially waste management). But the solution cannot rely on public acceptance for public policy, since the established system bent on preventing public acceptance is so well-funded.  So a cost-effective or profitable solution is required, in which we won't need public buy-in.  I am new to your channel (liked and subscribed today). If you havent already, would you please consider doing a video exploring who else is attempting what solutions, around the world? For example, carbon capture and sequestration with Sir Richard Branson and David Keith of Harvard. Thanks!  Then there's who's doing what in geoengineering, sulphates, sun shields, etc. It's vital to know what is being planned and even attempted, because it affects us all.  I think it's very important that conservatives speak up about how to address climate change. When we can harness their power and motivation for positive effect, then we can accomplish a lot!  I hope to see more videos from you on this topic. Thanks again!	1	false	0

UgyJ3eOH07mWXwgJqwV4AaABAg	TheEshaw1	4 hours ago	1536027852142	It's refreshing to hear someone on the right not be a climate change denier and I think I agree that there doesn't seem to be a political solution to climate change. Abolishing capitalism seems to be the worst thing we could do, because the chaos that would ensue, as it does in any system change, would likely hinder technological and scientific innovation for decades. I actually don't think anybody on the left wants to abolish capitalism; nobody in the democratic party does certainly. I'm in the DSA and Bernie is considered a conservative within that organization, but basically no one in this far left organization want the immediate destruction of capitalism. I think everyone knows that is a pipe dream and could only be achieved through violence. That's why it is called democratic socialism, because we think any real change has to be done democratically, by expanding democracy in the workplace and by making our voices heard through peaceful protest. To become a socialist country that actually succeeds at providing everyone an acceptable standard of living, we need to build up socialist institutions and activism that address the problems of massive inequality, racial and gender discrimination, etc. that our current system has been failing to address. Changing to socialism without laying any groundwork for it, would be disastrous. I also think our system has kind of failed on climate change as well; a big reason why we are in a dire situation with climate change is because companies hid evidence about climate change, funded bunk science and misinformation, and failed to invest properly in renewable technologies for decades with the goal of maintaining short term profits. If not for that we might have already made the transition to renewable energies. This shows a major way in which capitalism can resist needed change to address real problems. It is unclear whether another system would have done better, but there is clearly something left to be desired with capitalism.	0	false	0

Ugz46sAnmFdTJ6gl0iB4AaABAg	Tb Thomas	5 hours ago	1536024253720	This is the first time in over 10 years (during which I have been studying the subject) I've heard anyone who actually sounds like a legitimate 'conservative' willing to confront the reality of what is taking place  in the Arctic (and Antarctic, to a lesser degree for the moment).   When I interviewed Prof. Sherwood Rowland back in 1975 on the subject of his CFC research, I thought the response to the CFC problem was relatively prompt. ("You Can't Lose the Ozone" http://voices.revealdigital.com/cgi-bin/independentvoices?a=d&d=BFBJFGD19750704.1.8&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN---------------1)  Recently, I checked (with the benefit of Google, which I did not have back then), it turns out it took decades to get serious action fully doing away with the use of Chlorofluorocarbons.   Its pathetic that the Vigilante Left is so pernicious and self-destructive, that I have to work hard to support Trump, regardless of his stupidity on some subjects. (On the other hand, his place in SE Florida, 'Mar a Lago' is high on the list of places which will be 'first inundated' by rising sea levels.)  Here's the deal 'Potholer54': this is just a guess, but my impression is the deterioration of the Arctic cryosphere is accelerating, to a degree that will require some sort of consensus on mitigating the damage sooner than the private-sector is likely to respond to it. There are three major issues in the Arctic which are of concern:   1. The loss of almost all of the multi-year sea-ice, which effectively locks in a warming sea-temperature feedback loop. (And that's essentially a done deal.) 2. The massive (but superficially non-obvious) deterioration in the Greenland Ice Sheet, which could reach a tipping point in the near future (5 years?) and probably will reach a tipping point in the intermediate term (20 years).  3. The acceleration in decomposition of shallow sea-bed methane hydrates, saturation of the arctic sea-water column, followed by release of that methane into the atmosphere.   IMHO, we need to treat the combination of these un-certain, but still plausible trends as if they were certainties. Why? Very simple: if we wait until the evidence is overwhelming (in other words, if we wait for a 'Climate Change Pearl Harbor' to take action), it will be too late.   FDR knew we were going to end up in a war with Hitler even before the French surrendered to Germany in June of 1940. But thats when he picked up the phone and asked William Knudsen, CEO of General Motors at the time, to lead a private-sector initiative to prepare for war. That 18-month head-start may have been a decisive factor in the outcome of WWII, although know one can say for sure.   We need to 'urge' our oil & gas companies to begin developing the means to excavate and process the massive methane hydrate resources which have been sequestered on sea-beds for millions of years, and use them to produce cost-effective hydrogen gas as our primary fuel source. We also need to develop deep-ocean aquaculture, such that we can thoroughly modernize and utilize the productive potential of the planet's oceans, for food, but most of all, for transportable liquid fuels (bio-diesel) which is carbon neutral.   Apropos that last item. (And I am the furthest thing from a Dem/Lib/Leftist you will ever find...) Jimmy Carter's 'Aquatic Species Research' initiative in 1977 produced very solid evidence that 'algal farming' could be used to produce a viable carbon-neutral liquid fuel alternative to petro-fuels. The only thing left out in that study was a recognition that in order to produce bio-diesel at a scale and price which uses market forces to 'beat petro-fuels at the pump', we need hundreds of square miles of equatorial ocean under cultivation in order to do it. (If Richard Branson had responded to my explanation of how to do that back in 2007, we'd already be doing it today.) Unfortunately, the private sector (and companies already making massive profits by sticking with the status quo) are unlikely to take decisive action in an entirely new direction, without some clear and present danger to their current profit projections.   I am sorry to say, the human race, more particularly, our civilization -- which stands now at the pinnacle of its success over 40,000 years -- may have also reached it's 'peter point'. We seem unable to comprehend the idea that burning up (50%?) of a resource that took 500-million years to accumulate -- in less than 200 years -- is a bad idea.  Thanks for bringing some sanity to the conservative side of the discussion of this important subject.   PS: The reason the Libs have failed to even slow down the pace of climate-change, is precisely as was stated: they don't really give a damn about climate change, they just thirst for any opportunity to bash free-enterprise, capitalism, and the fact that greed has in fact been the driving force behind our success as a species -- from day one.	0	false	0						
UgzxRz6clRDdaxgNSRd4AaABAg	Paul Gracey	6 hours ago	1536020653732	China has shown one of the key flaws with your proposition that a Free Market can do what needs to be done. China is a top down autocratic one party system that takes its cut off the top of the Capitalism they have chosen to embrace. It has definitely opened itself up to trade with the rest of the world since Mao, but Democracy for choosing its leaders is verbotten. So when there is excess wind power up north they can command a shutdown whereas in a truly free market that energy must be sold at a loss.   Capitalism has some very positive benefits when the playing field is kept level, but restraint of trade, secret trade deals  and other perfidies tend to rot it when it is most powerful, and stifling to the little guys trying to stay up with the powerful. Trump is the rotten result of the changes made once Reagan was bought and sold to the American people by the back room deals hatched during the Carter administration to make up for the defeat they suffered during Watergate. Nixon and his crony capitalist (and some mafioso types) enablers pried opened the Chinese floodgates despite  that their right of center publicists had spent decades  accusing the Democrats for wanting to do business with Communists.  Mao's policies were not good for China, though he still lies in honor there, and the Chinese are still nominally Communists.  So open, free markets, with transparency so that everyone knows the rules and has a chance in the marketplace needs a free press, just as democracy does. But that is not the case in China. Sorry that you have been snookered into believing all that you saw there.  The other parts of the Carter solar panels are also in museums here in the U.S. and Carter still believes in service to all mankind, not just the ones paying obeisance to the hegemony he once represented.	0	true	1

Not only through undeserved tax breaks but also through regulatory loopholes, the most egregious of which is probably EPA's misclassification of oil and gas waste as residual rather than hazardous waste. That scam was foisted on us even though EPA's own studies found that most oil and gas wastes contain toxic chemicals - often at rates tens or hundreds of times in excess of EPA's claimed safe levels - and despite the fact that EPA regulates some of these chemicals as hazardous in other industries. And even when these racketeers violate the lax regulations by deliberately dumping toxic waste illegally or polluting water supplies, the government slaps them on the wrist or actively colludes in a whitewash. The level at which this industry externalizes its costs, risks and harms has taken a quantum leap since we've passed peak oil and they started exploiting inherently unprofitable extreme fossil fuels, ie, fracked oil & gas, tar sands and deep water drilling. And this is without considering the wars, coups and other misery this industry inflicts on people around the globe. If the government had kept its big fat thumb off the scales, the free market would have sent oil and gas the way of the horse and buggy years ago.	0	false	0

They use capitalism as a scapegoat for so many complex issues. From racism to the cure for cancer, they think every issue can be fixed if we switch to communism. In fact, I think it's because of capitalism being tampered with that fossil fuels have such an iron grip on our economy. Because of all of the benefits of renewable energy, fossil fuels have every reason to be outmoded by now. But because of the corruption of our system, giving unfair advantages oil and coal companies, we're not there yet.	0	false	0

The problem isn't that it isn't theoretically possible to reverse climate change through Free Market Capitalism, the problem is that there isnt a strong enough profit motive (the main engine of capitalist ingenuity) to do so- and when there may finally be a strong enough one it will likely be too late for us to reverse it. Also, Thatcher didn't deny the science- but she did continue policies that basically amounted to a lot more material destruction of the environment than any actual positive climate action that that good will speech she gave could have mustered up.	0	false	0

BUT...... CO2 is not a greenhouse gas nor is there enough to have the slightest effect, if it were! Sensible scientists avoid the fraudulent UN  IPCC like the plague.  There is real evidence, acres of it, from REAL scientist conducting REAL research which reveals the N political manipulations trying to bring about redistribution of world capital.  CO2 is classified as a RARE or TRACE gas,,,,so rare that it's hard to trace in the atmosphere. Plant life is struggling because there isn't enough. There's less CO2 than argon. It's level, most of which is entirely un-man made, is .0038 %  To get a grip on what that means...imagine dumping 1 million white golf balls on a golf course outside the 19th hole  ( The Lady Captain might have something to say about that!) on top of a bucketful of 380 red ones and trying find them, If you could find them all, most of them would be natural CO2 balls and a very few would be Industrial Revolution ones. As CO2 isn't a GreenHouse gas anyway, AND is amongst the heaviest atmospheric gas by far, ( A balloon filled with CO2 drops like a rubber encased horseshoe) it can't get up to the fraudulent Gore CO2 belt in the upper atmosphere. Even if it did get up there and even if it WERE a greenhouse gas, which it ISN'T,  it's effect would be less than a fart in the wind compared to the amount of CO2, naturally released by the earth and oceans. ANYWAY, genuine evidence taken from Ice Core samples etc. has shown conclusively that over Billions of Glacial years, increased CO2 levels always follow temperature rises, never precede them.  NEVER! And the highest ever CO2 level have occurred DURING glaciation periods,  So the 97% of UN Commodore C64, IPCC cheats, modellers and projectionists, time has come to admit the folly, forsake your bribe incomes (That WILL be very difficult!	0	true	1

Sadly here in Australia our conservative government are both climate change deniers a scientifically illiterate to the point that they deliberately slashed funding to our scientific brains trust and researchers the CSIRO. They deliberately targeted climate change and renewable energy research. They only recently suggested ditching cuts to emissions: Ref: https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/17/turnbull-ditches-emissions-legislation-to-head-off-backbench-dissent The extreme right wing consecutive elements of the government, which is the majority and hence the overthrow of the inept Malcolm Turnbull PM, are pushing for boosting mining, export and burning of coal and the construction of new coal fired power stations.  While, if Australia as a land mass and population vanished over night the net change to the world CO2 emissions would be negligible, probably less that 1.0% of the CO2 produced by America, China and India. However change and pressure to bring down CO2 needs to brought about on these nations and Australia. While China is investing in renewable energy they still consume extensive tonnages of coal and own or have significant shares in Australian coal mines. Unfortunately getting the top three or four polluters to reduce is very doubtful and bleak for future generations.	0	false	0

At the moment renewables are pretty much the only new generation projects in the pipeline mostly because of the base economics showing they are more economically efficient than coal so the private sector has been announcing wind, solar, batteries and hydro fairly vigorously - but that might change as a recent ousting of our PM has led to more pro-coal voices gaining leadership of the governing COALition party, and they've been voicing their eagerness to put taxpayer's money into creating new coal plants.

Another thing to bear in mind is that ice core samples, though easily differentiated into year segments, do not give the CO2 concentration for that year. Before these layers are compressed, the CO2 will diffuse into the layers beneath it (and those layers upwards). You get, in the end, an average of the surrounding 100 years or so.

UgxxKbV1X64EfJPkUBp4AaABAg	Ryan Rittenhouse	8 hours ago	1536013456833	Fossil fuels were the fuels used, but they are not, and were never, the only option. The industrial revolution happened because of technological innovation and scientific discovery and invention, not because of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels like coal, oil, and methane gas had been known of for centuries, millennia even. They were just a fuel source to power modern machines, but they have never been the only option for fuel.  The first few years of automobile manufacture saw more electric vehicles produced than ICE vehicles. Diesel engines were designed to run on peanut oil, petroleum corporations devised diesel fuel specifically to run in diesel engines (so that they wouldn't lose that market share). Tesla and Edison debated on whether coal or hydropower should be the main method of electricity generation throughout the country. Tesla showed that the current need for lighting could be met with distributed, run of river hydro systems across the country.  In 1918, Tesla said, "If we use fuel to get our power we are living on our capital and exhausting it rapidly. This method is barbarous and wantonly wasteful and must be stopped in the interest of coming generations."  Fossil fuels won out not because they were necessary, or the best choice, but because rich, controlling interests stood to make the most money (and still do) by exploiting those fossil fuels, profiting off them. They were never the only choice.  It is a great error to assert that simply because something happened a certain way that that was the only way it could have happened.	1	false	0

I think nuclear power should be expanded and used as a base of energy production with renewables serving alongside.   From what I understand, we've hit the point of diminishing returns on battery technology. I like the ideas of other forms of energy storage, but can they be tapped in periods of intermittent power production such as a cloud blocking a solar panel for a short period of time?   Resources are another concern. For the resources needed to energy produced, nuclear wins hands down. Lifetime of production is another concern.  Sure, I'd love to see all of much concerns addressed and overcome. Research should always be done to push the limits of technology. I'm just not placing faith in hypothetical solutions when workable solutions stare us in the face.	1	false	0

It isn't a fact that one is directly related to the other"  Stop fabricating.  Earth takes in energy from space (ex: solar energy) and releases energy. If Earth releases less energy then it takes in, then this creates an energy imbalance, which results in Earth warming. This is somewhat analogous to what happens to you when you wear a thick blanket: the blanket slows the rate at which you release heat in the environment. Since your body is also generating heat through muscle contractions and other processes, an energy imbalance results and you heat up. Note that the blanket can heat you up, even if the blanket is cooler than your body; a heated blanket is not required for warming you.  Now, greenhouse gases (GHGs) like CO2 absorb longer-wavelength, lower energy radiation, and thus slow down the rate at which Earth releases energy. This is explained at a laymen's level here:  "Yet we might expect scientifically literate people to produce a brief, mechanistic, global warming explanationâ€”as in these 35 words: â€œEarth transforms sunlight's visible light energy into infrared light energy, which leaves Earth slowly because it is absorbed by greenhouse gases. When people produce greenhouse gases, energy leaves Earth even more slowlyâ€”raising Earth's temperature.â€" http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tops.12187/full  Also see: "Sixth-Grade Studentsâ€™ Progress in Understanding the Mechanisms of Global Climate Change" "Comparing the effects of traditional vs. misconceptions-based instruction on student understanding of the greenhouse effect" "A mental picture of the greenhouse effect: A pedagogic explanation" "Infrared Radiation and Planetary temperature"  More technical explanations here: "The spectral signature of recent climate change" "Observational determination of surface radiative forcing by CO2 from 2000 to 2010" "Increases in greenhouse forcing inferred from the outgoing longwave radiation spectra of the Earth in 1970 and 1997" "Global atmospheric downward longwave radiation at the surface from ground-based observations, satellite retrievals, and reanalyses"  Thus, CO2 creates an energy imbalance, thereby warming the Earth. That's covered in sources such as: "Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earthâ€™s energy balance" "Insights into Earthâ€™s Energy imbalance from multiple sources" "Reconciling estimates of ocean heating and Earthâ€™s radiation budget" "Observed and simulated full-depth ocean heat-content changes for 1970â€“2005"  Therefore, CO2 drives warming, as discussed in sources such as: "On the causal structure between CO2 and global temperature" "Climate sensitivity in the geologic past" "Changing atmospheric CO2 concentration was the primary driver of early Cenozoic climate" "CO2 as a primary driver of Phanerozoic climate" "CO2-forced climate thresholds during the Phanerozoic" "The impact of Miocene atmospheric carbon dioxide fluctuations on climate and the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems"    "The sun has been virtually eliminated from the current calculations, and as history shows, is the most potent driver of climate on earth."  Stop lying, denialist.  Climate scientists don't ignore the Sun. They just know that the Sun did not cause the recent global warming, while anthropogenic greenhouse gases did cause most of the post-1950s or post-1970s global warming. There are at least 6 different lines of evidence for this claim:  1) Significant global warming remains even after correcting for total solar irradiance (TSI).  2) The relationship between solar output and global warming fails a number of statistical tests and model-based tests.  3) Solar output has not correlated well with recent global warming.  4) The stratosphere cooled, in accordance with CO2-induced global warming, but not solar-induced warming.  5) Observed cooling of the mesosphere and thermosphere, atmospheric layers above the stratosphere, fits with CO2-induced global warming.  6) CO2 absorbs energy in particular wavelengths, shifting Earth's energy balance (the amount of energy the Earth takes up vs. the amount of energy the Earth releases). Climate sensitivity states how much warming results from CO2's energy absorption. Scientists estimate climate sensitivity in a number of ways, such as examining how much warming occurred with CO2 increases in the distant past. Scientists can then use these climate sensitivity estimates to determine how much of the recent global warming was caused by the increased CO2. When scientists apply these climate sensitivity estimates to recent CO2 levels and warming, it shows that increased CO2 caused most of the recent warming, not CO2.   Here's NASA dumbing it down:  "But several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the sun: - Since 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the sun either remained constant or increased slightly. - If the warming were caused by a more active sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere. - Climate models that include solar irradiance changes canâ€™t reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases." http://climate.nasa.gov/causes/  And here are some scientific papers showing that the Sun did not cause most of the recent global warming:  "The impact of the revised sunspot record on solar irradiance reconstructions" "Variations in solar luminosity and their effect on the Earth's climate" "Cosmic rays, solar activity and the climate" "Deducing multidecadal anthropogenic global warming trends using multiple regression analysis" "Global temperature evolution 1979â€“2010" "Spectrally dependent CLARREO infrared spectrometer calibration requirement for climate change detection" "Recent oppositely directed trends in solar climate forcings and the global mean surface air temperature" "Causes of the Global Warming Observed since the 19th Century" "Evidence of recent causal decoupling between solar radiation and global temperature" "Statistical assessments of anthropogenic and natural global climate forcing.

								UgwtuZinD8-XY6c-PwR4AaABAg.8kkBvjveYrL8kkd6vCpNTh	Atomsk's Sanakan	6 hours ago	1536020663817	+Johnny Jones  "You didn't know that water vapour was the most dominant source of global warming"  I've explained this to you before, denialist troll. You're just too dumb+dishonest to acknowledge it. Once again:   There are at least 5 reasons why CO2 is more significant for long-term global warming than is water vapor:  1) CO2 absorbs energy at wavelengths missed by water vapor. 2) CO2 has a longer atmospheric residence time than does water vapor. 3) Atmospheric water vapor levels are more responsive to temperature changes than are atmospheric CO2 levels; that is: CO2 is a non-condensing greenhouse gas, while water vapor is a condensing greenhouse gas. So water vapor is worse at driving up long-term warming on its own, since it will typically fall as precipitation if atmospheric temperature drops too low. 4) There's a robust, long-term correlation between CO2 and temperature. 5) At best, water vapor serves as fast feedback that amplifies the warming from factors such as CO2. Clouds that develop from water vapor, can also act as fast positive feedback or as negative feedback, depending on how high those clouds are in the atmosphere. These effects are important, since CO2-induced global warming has augmented atmospheric water vapor levels, as expected, since warmer air can hold more moisture.

The US is currently so dogmatic in its "free market Capitalism" that it cannot even fix its issues in healthcare that every other developed country did a long time ago because those solutions go against "free enterprise".

The more prosperous and/or diverse the society, the harder it gets to accomplish goals without "tricking" most of the electorate. And when "tricking" the electorate occupies a certain percentage of your time, you reach a critical mass where it just makes more sense to be a politician for the sake of being a politician, and this encourages sociopaths to take over government, with no goals other than their personal empowerment.  In short, the Golden Quarter (1947-1973 ... Jackie Robinson to the first oil shock) increased prosperity, and then diversity of the USA. Starting with Nixon's Southern Strategy, the country became evermore dominated by sociopathic behavior. Then the end of the Cold War removed our most clarifying, unifying principle.

Furthermore we pay our electricity (consumer prices) more than half less compared to Germans who are fully devoted to their solar/wind plans.  You also disregard the process behind the extraction of rare earth metals,which do not provide renewables with a net carbon footprint advantage; its just moving the pollution to where they are extracted, mainly in China. but we all live on the same planet..

UgwY6bR8sAACEhpQFv94AaABAg	Peter	11 hours ago	1536002665297	REAL science is based on measurements not theorizing or modeling. According to actual measurements, the climate is warming up at a rate of about 1 degree C per century. Over the last 200,000 years, the climate has been 10 degrees C lower and one time 5 degrees higher than the average of the 20th century. Over the last 8,000 years the temperature has fluctuated between +2 and -2 degrees C. The current warming is well within normal climate fluctuation, even the speed of warming is not a record, as the temperature has gone up faster in the past. The whole "hockey stick" graph of Al Gore/Michael Mann is a deliberate falsification. As the temperature was higher in the past and went down again, all the "feedback loops" leading to catastrophic warming are unproven. Methane is continually created, and destroyed in the ozone layer. The model in which all loss of warmth is via radiation is a very incomplete model. Much heat is transferred via air movement (convection). And wind goes also up/down. Water vapor adds to the transport of heat to the higher layers of the atmosphere: water absorbs heat when it vaporizes, but radiates heat when it condenses high in the atmosphere. The global wind speeds are going down (google "global stilling") and this is a good explanation for the current warming trend. Furthermore, the most important greenhouse gas is water vapor. While CO2 went up from 0.03 percent to 0.04 percent, water vapor makes up to 1% of the atmosphere. So it is unclear whether CO2 has anything more than a marginal effect on the climate compared to water vapor. Also, CO2 is not poisonous to humans below 1%. Going from 0.03 to 0.04% has no biological impact upon humans. It does however make plants grow faster, plants need at least 0.1% of CO2 (1000 ppm) to grow optimally. CO2 makes the planet greener (which is confirmed by NASA satellites), making the term "green energy" for non-CO2 energy rather ludicrous and nonsensical. I conclude that CO2 is NOT pollution. And this CO2 doomsday cult distracts from real problems like real pollution (e.g. heavy metals).	2	true	4

								UgwY6bR8sAACEhpQFv94AaABAg.8kk5H_2G1s_8kkgUqIFN3U	Atomsk's Sanakan	5 hours ago	1536024266213	+Peter  "The current warming is well within normal climate fluctuation"  Stop being silly.  There are quite a number of ways we can confirm that the the vast majority of recent CO2 increase is anthropogenic. For example, we can:  1) use carbon isotope ratios in atmospheric CO2 [anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel burning would drop the relative proportions of C13 and C14] 2) show that the oceans likely aren't a net releaser of CO2, since the oceans are acidifying [indicative of net CO2 uptake,  not net CO2 release] and CO2 levels are increasing in the oceans 3) measure emissions from other non-anthropogenic sources [such as volcanoes], and see that anthropogenic emissions outweigh those sources 4) observe the decreased atmospheric O2 levels that one would expect from burning of fossils fuels as a contributor to CO2 emissions 5) observe the correlation between increased anthropogenic CO2 emissions and increased atmospheric CO2 6) examine the radiative forcing and temperature response changed from before to after the industrial revolution, consistent with anthropogenic CO2 emissions resulting in warming [as opposed to it just being non-anthropogenic] 7) mass balance argument, where the total amount of CO2 released by anthropogenic fossil fuel combustion is greater than the amount of CO2 accumulating in the atmosphere [so non-anthropogenic sources are acting as a net sink for CO2]  And there are quite a number of ways to tell that increased CO2 caused most of the post-1950s global warming. For example:  1) Post-1950s stratospheric cooling 2) Post-1950s mesospheric cooling 3) Post-1950s thermospheric cooling 4) Post-1950s increase in radiation absorption at a wavenumber of ~666 cycles per cm, and other frequencies CO2 is expected is to absorb at. 5) Horizontal/regional distribution of warming and the temporal pattern of warming [DOI: 10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00191.1, pages 1683 and 1684] 6) Estimates of climate sensitivity (in excess of 3K for ECS) based on proxy records for CO2 and temperature. 7) Exclusion of other likely causal factors, such as the Sun (ex: solar-induced warming causes warming of the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere, yet scientists observed cooling in these layers).  So if humans caused the vast majority of CO2 increase and the CO2 increase caused most of the recent warming, then that that makes a pretty strong case that anthropogenic increases in CO2 are driving the warming. I've covered the second set of points at length elsewhere:  http://blamethenoctambulantjoycean.blogspot.com/2018/04/myth-attributing-warming-to-co2_30.html  Some background sources on this latter point on recent CO2-induced warming:  "Comment on â€œClimate Science and the Uncertainty Monsterâ€ by J. A. Curry and P. J. Webster" "Assessing the observed impact of anthropogenic climate change" "Causes of irregularities in trends of global mean surface temperature since the late 19th century" "On the causal structure between CO2 and global temperature" "Attribution of observed historical near-surface temperature variations to anthropogenic and natural causes using CMIP5 simulations" "Early onset of industrial-era warming across the oceans and continents" "Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earthâ€™s energy balance" "Attributing Observed SST Trends and Subcontinental Land Warming to Anthropogenic Forcing during 1979â€“2005" "Sensitivity of the attribution of near surface temperature warming to the choice of observational dataset" "Scaling fluctuation analysis and statistical hypothesis testing of anthropogenic warming" "A probabilistic quantification of the anthropogenic component of twentieth century global warming" "Quantifying anthropogenic influence on recent near-surface temperature change" "Identifying human influences on atmospheric temperature" Whole atmosphere simulation of anthropogenic climate change"    "The whole "hockey stick" graph of Al Gore/Michael Mann is a deliberate falsification."  Stop being a denialist.  See the following Youtube video from potholer54: "23 -- Medieval Warm Period -- fact vs. fiction"  In that video (from about 2:10), potholer54 discussed the hockey stick pattern, in which recent global warming occurs at a much faster rate than warming during the MWP [medieval warm period]. potholer54 also discusses the multiple lines of research supporting this hockey stick pattern. And figure 4 of the following paper again confirms the hockey stick pattern by comparing different temperature constructions:  "Continental-scale temperature variability during the last two millennia"  Also see figure 3 of: "Climate variability and change since 850 CE: An ensemble approach with the Community Earth System Model"  The hockey stick shows up in a number of different proxy records, as shown in: "A global multiproxy database for temperature reconstructions of the Common Era"  The hockey stick pattern also shows up in the following papers:  Figure 2A, page 620: "Pacific Ocean heat content during the past 10,000 years" "Inter-hemispheric temperature variability over the past millennium" Figure 7: "800-yr-long records of annual air temperature and precipitation over southern Siberia inferred from Teletskoye Lake sediments" "Recent warming reverses long-term Arctic cooling"  So subsequent research largely confirmed Mann's hockey stick pattern, while undermine the flawed re-analyses done by his critics.  The following paper addresses, and rebuts, criticism of the hockey stick pattern: "Robustness of the Mann, Bradley, Hughes reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures: Examination of criticisms based on the nature and processing of proxy climate evidence"  Mann even showed the same hockey stick pattern without the tree ring proxies that some people had objected to: "Proxy-based reconstructions of hemispheric and global surface temperature variations over the past two millennia"  That ties in nicely with Mann's earliest co-authored work on the hockey stick: From 1998: "Global-scale temperature patterns and climate forcing over the past six centuries" From 1999: "Northern hemisphere temperatures during the past millennium: Inferences, uncertainties, and limitations"  Also, the following paper compares recent warming to Northern Hemisphere temperatures back to 1000AD. This data seems to suggest modern warming stronger than that seen in the medieval periods displayed (see figure 2): "Ensemble reconstruction constraints on the global carbon cycle sensitivity to climate"  Furthermore, see the following for an alternative account, where recent modern temperatures were warmer than the vast majority of the Holocene, reversing a long-term cooling trend: "A reconstruction of regional and global temperature for the past 11,300 years"  For further discussion of this at a laymen's level, see: https://www.skepticalscience.com/broken-hockey-stick.htm	0

While CO2 went up from 0.03 percent to 0.04 percent, water vapor makes up to 1% of the atmosphere. So it is unclear whether CO2 has anything more than a marginal effect on the climate compared to water vapor."  Once again, you're silly.  >99% of the atmosphere is not relevant here, since this portion is made up of non-greenhouse gases that don't absorb much longer wavelength radiation and re-emit this energy; i.e. they don't engage in relevant radiative forcing. This includes gases like nitrogen, oxygen and argon. That leaves us with the greenhouse gases that do engage in radiative forcing.  Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the lower atmosphere. There are at least 5 reasons why CO2 is more significant for long-term global warming than is water vapor:  1) CO2 absorbs energy at wavelengths missed by water vapor. 2) CO2 has a longer atmospheric residence time than does water vapor. 3) Atmospheric water vapor levels are more responsive to temperature changes than are atmospheric CO2 levels; that is: CO2 is a non-condensing greenhouse gas, while water vapor is a condensing greenhouse gas. So water vapor is worse at driving up long-term warming on its own, since it will typically fall all precipitation is atmospheric temperature drops too low. 4) There's a robust, long-term correlation between CO2 and temperature. 5) At best, water vapor serves as fast feedback that amplifies the warming from factors such as CO2. Clouds that develop from water vapor, can also act as fast positive feedback or as negative feedback, depending on how high those clouds are in the atmosphere. These effects are important, since CO2-induced global warming has augmented atmospheric water vapor levels, as expected, since warmer air can hold more moisture. So atmospheric humidity increased during the recent period of pronounced global warming (from about the late 1970s to the present), with a humidity decrease during the global cooling / temperature stagnation period of ~1940s to the 1970s.  So we're now left with CO2, methane (CH4), and the other non-condensing greenhouse gases; all of them are trace gases. Though an individual CH4 molecule has more of a warming impact than an individual molecule of CO2, CO2 is a more important greenhouse gas than is CH4 for a number of reasons. For example:  1) CO2 is more abundant in the atmosphere. 2) Bacteria break down much of the methane to form CO2.  3) CO2 has a longer atmospheric residence time than methane, since methane readily reacts with other molecules higher in the atmosphere. 4) Methane levels, and methane's impact energy balance, have begun leveling off, while CO2 levels and impact continue to increase. 5) Methane ends up being responsible for a minority of the anthropogenic impact on energy balance, with CO2 making up the majority.   Therefore CO2 will have more of an impact of long-term warming than would CH4. Thus methane ends up being responsible for a minority of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming, though this is still a sizable minority.   So that's how a trace gas like CO2 could have a large impact on long-term global warming, even in the presence of more abundant gases like water vapor and nitrogen.    "As the temperature was higher in the past and went down again, all the "feedback loops" leading to catastrophic warming are unproven."  Stop dishonestly attacking a straw man.  "Another claim advanced by those who reject the mainstream scientific agreement on climate is that the consensus position consists of a claim of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming or the frequently used acronym CAGW [...]. However, CAGW is rarely, if ever, defined or sourced to a mainstream scientific organization or study. Any scientific studyâ€™s result, or statement by a researcher, that does not fit a contrarianâ€™s personal, flexible definition of CAGW can therefore be adopted as ostensibly supporting their view and refuting the mainstream, even when such results are actually consistent with the mainstream position on climate [...].  [...] Additionally, we find that catastrophic anthropogenic global warming [CAGW] is essentially a term that is never used in the relevant scientific literature by mainstream sources. Furthermore, in the press it appears to be used exclusively by climate contrarians. The term is typically neither defined nor attributed to a mainstream scientific source. Our conclusion is therefore that CAGW is simply a straw man used by climate contrarians to criticize the mainstream position (50)." https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20161-0_3  potholer54 also objects to that "CAGW" straw man here: "28 - The consequences of climate change (in our lifetimes)", from 13:40 to 15:42	0

A little more than a decade ago was when I noticed that conservatives were almost totally painted as anti science, and anti gay bible thumpers. The only real argument I heard for this was stating that the majority of climate change deniers were conservative, and spamming logical fallacies in place of arguments. While technically true, it doesn't prove that conservatism itself is an ideology against science, only notes a strong link between a handful of disagreements with established scientific data and conservative ideology. The same now is said of many prominent leftists, but no one is saying as fervently that liberal ideology is inherently anti science...yet.	0	true	2

Even if the first premise were true, this is still a bad way 'to science'.  "no one is saying as fervently that liberal ideology is inherently anti science" - This must be your first day on the internet.

But either made by ignorance, or against regulation, and many times both. I don't think the sweeping generalisation was the point. I thought it was about not wanting to over simplify the problem to the point of strawmanning.  I should have said "popular" or "in general," not fervently. That's my fault. So in general, at least as much as I've seen leftists label conservatives as anti science in the past, was far more wide spread than labelling leftists as anti science for conflating trendy stylistic preferences with actual medical afflictions.  The race realism argument is...complicated. I've literally haven't heard anyone say that blacks are intellectually inferior in nearly 15 years.

"The truth is, that we brought with us the rights of men, of expatriated men. On our arrival here the question would at once arise, by what law will we govern ourselves?

Feudalism. Personal greed! Entitlement! The colonies were settled under Royal corporate charter. Corporate Law Trumps civil society.   Free enterprise - coming up with solutions to fix the problems they create. Like the environmental clean-up being paid for by everyone for mines and nuclear waste and error, not by the problem creators, the capitalists who got their profits despoiling the society.

American society always gets what it deserves politically and economically. The highest incarcerated population of citizens of any country, rampant poverty and the legislated freedom to enrich your corporation while paying wages which are substandard to living fully in society, while denying profit to those who produce the goods and services for the benefit of corporate owners. Allow the corporations to invest in foreign capitalist solutions (lowest wage costs), to take jobs from the society which grants their license. Thereâ€™s the capitalist incentive!

I think the poor bastard is getting desperate to get the right to go along with a greener economic scheme.  So much sloppy thinking.  Cleanup on isle 7...and 3....and....pretty much all of them.  Thinking error number 1) Conservatives don't accept climate change because some on the left are anti-capitalist.  The reality is that we don't know why they don't accept it.  At least, I have seen no studies on it.  And, it's pretty gross to blame the left for the CHOICES of the right.  It's like blaming SJW for Trump's rise: people on the right had about 10 different ways to handle not liking SJW and if they CHOOSE voting Trump, that's on them, nobody else.  That's ethics 101 and Potholers seems happy to shitcan it for expedience here.  Thinking error number 2) Capitalism is required for markets.  It's never said outright, but implied over and over in this video that "free markets" are a product of capitalism.  They're not.  Mondragon.  The end.  Markets can be 100% socialist....if you know what socialism actually is....  Thinking error number 3) You can get the right-wing to change their minds with data.  I mean....jesus.  Is this real?  Did Potholer read ANY of the psychological studies on arguing with conservatives: https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-sweeney/theres-no-arguing-with-co_b_126805.html BTW, even TRAINED SHRINKS have not only failed to help people, but they have been PROVEN to make things worse (treating sociopathy, psychopathy and the like INCREASED recitivism rates in inmates in some studies).  Conservatives are no different.  You will probably make things WORSE by trying to help them.    Thinking error number 4) That you need conservatives to even accept this shit for things to change.  Not stated, but implied throughout the video.  No, you don't.  Conservatives are 40% of the population.  We have ALREADY ENOUGH PEOPLE for change.  What we need is a STRONGER AND MORE RADICAL movement.  Did conservatives support ending Vietnam?  Did they support ending slavery?  Did they support civil rights?  Nope.  It was FORCED on them.

All we want is more power to the workers and less concentration of wealth at the top, no need to give up on innovation as a means of solving new problems.

Ugxam0yIoWViJscbEgt4AaABAg	Your Internet Friend	12 hours ago	1535999067441	That initial comment about you being a lefty is easily explained. Climate change is a political issue, as well as a scientific one. Republicans tend to reject climate change or at least human involvement. Democrats tend to accept climate change and human involvement. I'm looking at a pew study and for the question of whether "human behavior is mostly responsible for climate change" the US average is at 27% with the political spectrum being at (13%, 16%, 29%, 55%) for "cons repub", "moderate repub",  "moderate democrat" and "Liberal democrat".   I don't think that Democrats understand climate science any more than Republicans do. My guess is that both sides' positions are mostly based on their political affiliation. An indication for that is the fact that the results of the question whether scientists understand the cause of climate change almost perfectly matches the numbers for the above question: (11%, 19%, 28%, 54%). In other words those who reject human involvement also reject what climate scientists are saying.   So TL;DR, the rule is: If you are a lefty, you believe in man-made climate change. If you are a righty, you reject man-made climate change. Therefore, when fallaciously reversing the implications, if you believe in man-made climate change you are a lefty. Using this heuristic you'll still be correct most of the time.	0	false	0

It is true that there is quite a lot of conservatives who "don't believe" in climate change because the people putting the idea forward are often also in favor of leftist big-government nanny-state policies.  But, I also think that there also is some genuine healthy skepticism towards climate change.  First of all most scientists researching climate change are paid by governments and therefore are biased in favor of "more government".

That's a paranoid conspiracy theory that I'd expect of a denialist:  "Conspiracy Theories and Selective Distrust of Scientific Authority [...] Deniers argue that because scientists receive grant money, fame, and prestige as a result of their research, it is in their best interest to maintain the status quo [15]. This type of thinking is convenient for deniers as it allows them to choose which authorities to believe and which ones to dismiss as part of a grand conspiracy. In addition to being selective, their logic is also internally inconsistent." http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040256   Your paranoia is baseless and silly, for a number of reasons:   1) You trust the government and government-funded research; in fact, you rely on it everyday. For example, you likely eat processed food from sites certified by the FDA. You've likely taken medicines (or relied on medical technologies) generated by NIH-funded or CDC-funded research. You likely use satellite-based technologies that came from NASA-funded research. You likely drink clean water, breathe clean air, use unleaded gasoline, etc. largely thanks to EPA-funded research and testing. And so on.  So you're more than happy to rely on the fruits of government-funded research and trust government-funded research... as long as that research does not conflict with your pet ideology. Since you think climate science research conflicts with your conservative political ideology, you make up excuses for not accepting climate science research. So you're engaged in special pleading.   2) The idea of CO2-induced climate change dates back to the at least the 1890s, with Arrhenius' work. So you could hardly claim that CO2-induced climate change is a recent, government-funded conspiracy.   3) You're likely more than happy to buy into claims from contrarians like Roy Spencer, Richard Lindzen, John Christy, Judith Curry, Anthony Watts, David Legates, Willie Soon, Roger Pielke Sr., Craig Idso, etc. Yet each of them has co-authored work that was government-funded. So by your logic you shouldn't trust them, yet you likely rely on them anyway. So your position is internally inconsistent. This also debunks your idea that government-funding forces people to accept a "catastrophic" position.   4) You could use your same paranoid logic to reject government-funded research on well-supported claims such as:  - vaccines don't cause autism - smoking causes cancer - HIV causes AIDS - Earth is round, not flat etc.  and so on. Yet you likely wouldn't object to government-funded research on those claims. So you're engaged in special pleading.   5) There have been non-government-funded research efforts that confirmed the results of NASA-funded and NOAA-funded research. A classic example of this is the research for Berkeley Earth, led by Richard Muller. For more on this, see:  https://www.carbonbrief.org/challenge-defining-pre-industrial-era Figures 4 and 5: "Estimating changes in global temperature since the pre-industrial period" "Influence of urban heating on the global temperature land average using rural sites identified from MODIS classifications" "Earth atmospheric land surface temperature and station quality in the contiguous United States" Youtube: "Richard Muller: I Was wrong on Climate Change" "The conversion of a climate-change skeptic"	3

You didn't know that water vapour was the most dominant source of global warming. In actual fact you didn't even know that water vapour was actually a greenhouse gas. My advice stay away from intellectual debates."  I've explained this to you before, denialist troll. You're just too obtuse+deceitful to address it. Once again:   There are at least 5 reasons why CO2 is more significant for long-term global warming than is water vapor:  1) CO2 absorbs energy at wavelengths missed by water vapor. 2) CO2 has a longer atmospheric residence time than does water vapor. 3) Atmospheric water vapor levels are more responsive to temperature changes than are atmospheric CO2 levels; that is: CO2 is a non-condensing greenhouse gas, while water vapor is a condensing greenhouse gas. So water vapor is worse at driving up long-term warming on its own, since it will typically fall as precipitation if atmospheric temperature drops too low. 4) There's a robust, long-term correlation between CO2 and temperature. 5) At best, water vapor serves as fast feedback that amplifies the warming from factors such as CO2. Clouds that develop from water vapor, can also act as fast positive feedback or as negative feedback, depending on how high those clouds are in the atmosphere. These effects are important, since CO2-induced global warming has augmented atmospheric water vapor levels, as expected, since warmer air can hold more moisture. So atmospheric humidity increased during the recent period of pronounced global warming (from about the late 1970s to the present), with a humidity decrease during the global cooling / temperature stagnation period of ~1940s to the 1970s.

UgyCexTeLooZt5YS3654AaABAg	John David Miller	12 hours ago	1535999069661	CO2 is a greenhouse gas. That is it both absorbs and releases infrared photons. Once released, there is one chance in 41,253 that infrared photon will continue within one degree in the same direction. This basically gives that photon a 50/50 chance of going either up or down. Since the oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface, this gives that photon about a 35% chance of hitting a body of water. Infrared photons will not penetrate a body or water's surface, but will instead excite an H2O molecule causing evaporation. H2O is the primary greenhouse gas which prevents the Earth from having a climate like our moon. Consequently the more CO2 we put into the atmosphere, the more H2O gets into the atmosphere, the warmer the planet gets. This is how a 40% increase in CO2 caused a 7% increase in absolute humidity.  The present increase in temperature due to this combination of additional  H2O and CO2 in the atmosphere is approximately .9C at present.  Because it takes a tremendous amount of time for the oceans to heat, it will take centuries for the Earth to reach temperature equilibrium. If we continue to inject CO2 into the atmosphere, that heating process will continue to accelerate.	0	true	4

That is where 93% of the additional heat is being stored.

The imminent threat isn't sea level rise but a future of massive storm surges.   This website gives a more detailed explanation.	0

May, 1967 Manabe and Wetherald were the first to include all the main physical processes relevant to the problem, using a model that was no more complicated than necessary to achieve this. This led to much more realistic simulations and enabled the results to be explained in terms of processes which could be observed in the real world.  Manabe and Wetherald made a number of other discoveries. First, that the temperature of the stratosphere cooled markedly when carbon dioxide was doubled. This is the characteristic â€œfingerprintâ€ of increasing carbon dioxide: the troposphere warms and the stratosphere cools, as we have observed over the last 50 years.	0

As an American Capitalist I would love to return to a time when we had the "CAN DO" attitude.  I only have 2 problems thus far.    1) I'm very distrustful of any data coming out of China which you heavily relied on in this section.  They are not at it's core a capitalist country and their government has no problem with rigging the system at great cost to themselves to make their numbers look good on paper.  Also, They can support cheap manufacturing because they can supply a massive amount of underpaid labor that work in appalling conditions.  So, I think I need to see something that proves these reports are accurate and not manufactured BS.    2) The regulatory atmosphere in the US is contrived on both parts by the anti-capitalist/humanist sort of left AND by the mega-international conglomerates who fund our elections.  Both sides have taken turns putting more and more restriction on industry for various reasons and the net result being an oligarchic market with limited to no competition and no ability for new startups to form within our country as some of those oligarchies controlling our government are the very coal and petrol industries that have everything to lose.  For the time being any competition will need to come from the outside.    Finger wagging at the US is useless, when we're walking a tightrope in a 2 party system.  Voting for Trump was as close to voting for 3rd party as we've gotten in decades. You can say what you want about Trump's politics on the issue, but I believe that the core of MAGA is returning to that "CAN DO" attitude of the past for most people who are supportive.  True liberals in the US and Europe are fighting for space between the oligarchies that run our nations and the outright communists trying to take over.  Please don't lump us in with either side.  This is precisely the kind of road we want to take but our voice is drown out by the loud minorities with megaphones on either side.	1	false	0

Which will push the us further in this direction.

My understanding, however, was that leaded gasoline was an archetypical case, alongside smoking and climate change, of an industry throwing up scientific smoke-screens to keep making money off of poisoning everyone, and being stopped only eventually by government interventions (e.g. the Clean Air Act in the USA). A brief read of Kovarik's short history of TEL in fuel seems to confirm this received-wisdom impression rather than dispel it. In parrticular, it notes that alternatives were known for a long time but weren't implemented by the free market.  I'm not quite of the opinion that we need to abandon all free markets and go back to agrarianism (yet), but it seems a little. Audacious. To use such a bald-faced example of a successful intervention against what the free market was doing, and took legal action to try to continue doing. As an example of how it can hypothetically solve problems where the cost of pollution is broadly distributed and the benefit concentrated. >=[	0	false	0

Ironically, they never apply a similar burden of proof to the claims of their political system:  "The invisible hand of an unregulated free market always provides the optimum allocation of resources."

That's like saying:  "I find it hard to see how HIV could cause a disease like AIDS, since HIV viral particles makes up such a small proportion of my mass." "I find it hard to difficult to believe that my heart can pump blood, because my heart makes up such a small part of my mass." "I find it hard to difficult to believe that a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or 0.16 could detrimentally affect my thinking, because that amount makes up such a small proportion of my mass."  The mistakes here are obvious. For example, HIV can have a large effect on your body, even though it's mass is very small portion of your mass. Parallel point for a alcohol with respect to your blood alcohol concentration (or small amounts of sarin gas, or strychnine, or...) Moreover, most of your body's mass does not pump blood. This actually makes the heart even more important, since it makes up the portion of body mass that pumps blood.   You can extend these same points to atmosphere and CO2. >99% of the atmosphere is not relevant here, since this portion is made up of non-greenhouse gases that don't absorb much longer wavelength radiation and re-emit this energy; i.e. they don't engage in relevant radiative forcing. This includes gases like nitrogen, oxygen and argon. That leaves us with the greenhouse gases that do engage in radiative forcing.  Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the lower atmosphere. There are at least 5 reasons why CO2 is more significant for long-term global warming than is water vapor:  1) CO2 absorbs energy at wavelengths missed by water vapor. 2) CO2 has a longer atmospheric residence time than does water vapor. 3) Atmospheric water vapor levels are more responsive to temperature changes than are atmospheric CO2 levels; that is: CO2 is a non-condensing greenhouse gas, while water vapor is a condensing greenhouse gas. So water vapor is worse at driving up long-term warming on its own, since it will typically fall all precipitation is atmospheric temperature drops too low. 4) There's a robust, long-term correlation between CO2 and temperature. 5) At best, water vapor serves as fast feedback that amplifies the warming from factors such as CO2. Clouds that develop from water vapor, can also act as fast positive feedback or as negative feedback, depending on how high those clouds are in the atmosphere. These effects are important, since CO2-induced global warming has augmented atmospheric water vapor levels, as expected, since warmer air can hold more moisture. So atmospheric humidity increased during the recent period of pronounced global warming (from about the late 1970s to the present), with a humidity decrease during the global cooling / temperature stagnation period of ~1940s to the 1970s.  So we're now left with CO2, methane (CH4), and the other non-condensing greenhouse gases; all of them are trace gases. Though an individual CH4 molecule has more of a warming impact than an individual molecule of CO2, CO2 is a more important greenhouse gas than is CH4 for a number of reasons. For example:  1) CO2 is more abundant in the atmosphere. 2) Bacteria break down much of the methane to form CO2.  3) CO2 has a longer atmospheric residence time than methane, since methane readily reacts with other molecules higher in the atmosphere. 4) Methane levels, and methane's impact energy balance, have begun leveling off, while CO2 levels and impact continue to increase. 5) Methane ends up being responsible for a minority of the anthropogenic impact on energy balance, with CO2 making up the majority.   Therefore CO2 will have more of an impact of long-term warming than would CH4. Thus methane ends up being responsible for a minority of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming, though this is still a sizable minority.   So that's how a trace gas like CO2 could have a large impact on long-term global warming, even in the presence of more abundant gases like water vapor and nitrogen.	2
								Ugxzm7C-d9vKFjop48J4AaABAg.8kjoHBnfH2k8kk81fFRX6n	Atomsk's Sanakan	11 hours ago	1536002677952	++DJDiverDan436  " Yes, it has been demonstrated that CO2 is a greenhouse gas.  I will readily accept that as a given.  BUT it does NOT logically follow that CO2 is a primary, or even a material, driver of the warming.  The Earthâ€™s climate in incredibly complex, dynamic and chaotic, with a huge number of drivers and positive and negative feedbacks, including solar irradiance, solar magnetic activity, cyclical changes in the Earthâ€™s orbit, ocean currents, etc., etc"  Lung cancer is also complex and not fully understood. That doesn't change the fact that we know smoking and second-hand smoking causes most cases on lung cancer in the US; hence the evidence-based scientific consensus on that. The lesson here is that complexity does not prevent on from know the primary cause of something, nor does one need full knowledge of everything in order to identify a primary cause.   A parallel point applies to climate change: pointing out that stuff is "complex" or "not fully understood", does not rebut the evidence-based scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change. It does not change the fact that scientists know that humans caused most of the recent global warming:  "Arguments about the complex, multifactorial aetiology of [coronary heart disease] and cancer have long been used by the tobacco industry to dispute the epidemiological and other evidence. This approach to the evidence has also been documented in other industries, and the use of double standards in demands for evidence is a characteristic of many other fields. For example, car manufacturers fought the mandatory introduction of airbags and seatbelts in the 1960s as ineffective, and the alcohol industry and motoring organisations did the same with the introduction of the breathalyser to tackle drink driving in the 1960s. Demands for perfect evidence, while misrepresenting the existing evidence, can also be observed in climate change denialism." http://jech.bmj.com/content/71/11/1078   Anyway, there are quite a number of ways to tell that increased CO2 caused most of the post-1950s global warming. For example:  1) Post-1950s stratospheric cooling 2) Post-1950s mesospheric cooling 3) Post-1950s thermospheric cooling 4) Post-1950s increase in radiation absorption at a wavenumber of ~666 cycles per cm, and other frequencies CO2 is expected is to absorb at. 5) Horizontal/regional distribution of warming and the temporal pattern of warming [DOI: 10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00191.1, pages 1683 and 1684] 6) Estimates of climate sensitivity (in excess of 3K for ECS) based on proxy records for CO2 and temperature. 7) Exclusion of other likely causal factors, such as the Sun (ex: solar-induced warming causes warming of the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere, yet scientists observed cooling in these layers).  Some background sources on this latter point on recent CO2-induced warming:  "Comment on â€œClimate Science and the Uncertainty Monsterâ€ by J. A. Curry and P. J. Webster" "Assessing the observed impact of anthropogenic climate change" "Causes of irregularities in trends of global mean surface temperature since the late 19th century" "On the causal structure between CO2 and global temperature" "Attribution of observed historical near-surface temperature variations to anthropogenic and natural causes using CMIP5 simulations" "Early onset of industrial-era warming across the oceans and continents" "Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earthâ€™s energy balance" "Attributing Observed SST Trends and Subcontinental Land Warming to Anthropogenic Forcing during 1979â€“2005" "Sensitivity of the attribution of near surface temperature warming to the choice of observational dataset" "Scaling fluctuation analysis and statistical hypothesis testing of anthropogenic warming" "A probabilistic quantification of the anthropogenic component of twentieth century global warming" "Quantifying anthropogenic influence on recent near-surface temperature change" "Identifying human influences on atmospheric temperature" Whole atmosphere simulation of anthropogenic climate change"  And I also suggest you go read the following sources on CO2-induced warming:  "Climate sensitivity in the geologic past" "Changing atmospheric CO2 concentration was the primary driver of early Cenozoic climate" "CO2 as a primary driver of Phanerozoic climate" "CO2-forced climate thresholds during the Phanerozoic" "The impact of Miocene atmospheric carbon dioxide fluctuations on climate and the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems"	2

								UgxNDiRaQ52lQ4vi7c54AaABAg.8kjiuVb4yM98kkSAj5qZmK	Lewis Shab	8 hours ago	1536013480129	Potholer, the way you are describing Shapiro's stance towards climate change isn't accurate.  From the Rogan interview: Shapiro agreed that "It has been absolutely proven that human beings are having an effect on this carbon dioxide level... 100%" @5:40  He's a political commentator and much of his anti climate change rhetoric is towards the people claiming extreme consequences - not towards the science.  He also endorses a market solution to climate change just like in Freedonia.  He also endorses regulation for externalities around the 1:00 mark in the Rogan interview.  I think you are in the same pool as him.. paraphrasing: Lets stop talking about the science and start discussing the solution.  I don't see why you went after him so hard when he's a proponent for the science. There are many other political pundits who are not in the same camp.. for example Crowder or Alex Jones.	0

They're not ignorant to flywheels and the like; they just have no market incentive to advocate for it. Their capital, all of their R&D, their machinery, their homes and private lifestyles, all of it is funded by oil sales. Not wind, not solar. If you want the free market to solve it, then you'll have to deal with the U.S. government, which have already made their decision under Citizens United v. FEC. Couple that with geopolitics, most notable being our economic association with Saudi Arabia and our love of foreign interference with countries that attempt to change their economies, and you have the current U.S. economic system.

UgyptrHBCwlfJ-vFKfR4AaABAg	Nshan Burns	15 hours ago	1535988279545	Although I'm certain that, given enough time, the free market would minimize or neutralize humanity's carbon dioxide emissions, I am doubtful that it would achieve that in time. How long would it take to implement subsidy changes? How long would it take for the private sector to replace all our fossil fuel infrastructure? Even if renewable energy production becomes slightly more cost-effective than oil and coal, would it remain economical to keep the current means of energy production? How long will it take to convince (American) conservatives that you're not trying to destroy their precious, precious coal jobs?  Let's say we want to keep the global temperature effects of climate change under 2Â°C over pre-industrial levels. According to a Joeri Rogelj of the IIASA (et al), we would have ideally capped emissions at 40 gigatonnes back in 2015, which means we now must cut emissions even more rapidly to reach 20 Gt in 2038, and 0 Gt in 2065. If we want to restrict the temperature rise to the far less-disastrous level of 1.5Â°C, we would have capped around the same time, and now must reach 20 Gt in 2032, and 0 Gt in 2050. In both situations, we must then use carbon-capture technologies like you mentioned near the end of the video, as well as reverse the effects of deforestation, to drop global net emissions below zero and level out temperature rise. And we have already exceeded the emissions limits of both scenarios. Current projections have us continuing to raise emissions well into the future, and even in the MOST OPTIMISTIC scenario, they peak around 2050.   It's very unlikely that the private sector is going to create significant change anywhere near soon enough to avoid the cataclysmic effects of climate change. I'm no extremist, but it seems obvious that the only way to impose that kind of change is with restrictive and immediate government action. It's not like America hasn't done it before. It just needs to mobilize the country like it did in World War II.	0	false	0

Looking at long term data gives a much different construct of climate modelling for the future.  As a scientific mind, why would you disregard data from past milleniums?  Cherry picking data from the last couple hundred years, is an incomplete data set.  Ice ages happen with frequencies that cannot be dismissed.  Current CO levels are not at an alltime high...they were higher in the past, as per ice core samples indicate...before oil and gas were burned as a fossil fuel.  Variability in the atmosphere is the norm, thoughout history.  Climate warming, AND climate cooling are cyclical.  While ocean levels DO rise with warming trends, they also drop with cooling trends as well.  Are you implying that we will not see any more ice ages due to a runaway greenhouse effect in our atmosphere?  Do you dismiss meteor bombardment of Earth as having an effect on climate?  To do so is pulling the blinders over your eyes.  Look at the big picture, before coming to ANY conclusion.  One manâ€™s lifetime is minute on a cosmic scale.  Certainly irrevalant when forcasting future climate change.  Mankind does not have an effect on the rotation of our solar system around the Milky Way.  Do you factor in the changes of our galactic surroundings as we spin through space?  Levels of radiation from different sectors of space change with our solar systems positioning around our galaxy.  This is a factor that should be added to the equation.  I am not saying that an ice age is just around the corner....I am saying that influencial factors have been dismissed in MOST climate change modelling.  Thankyou.	0	false	0

We've known about climate change for a long time now, as Potholer showed; way before we had regulations. Exxon knew that what they were doing was detrimental to the climate since the 60s, admitted to doing so, and were never punished for it. Cruise liners have been polluting for a while, and it's certain that they tested their ship emissions. I would love for Potholer to have a discussion with, say, Professor Richard Wolff, if nothing more than to get a different perspective on the issue of climate change and capitalism, rather than writing them off as "extremists". These corporate behemoths are itching to get their chains off, however. We'll see what happens if they do.	0	false	0

UgzJWmwdwWeLUFTVbNd4AaABAg	Choco mel	15 hours ago	1535988281215	Another very interesting solution to storing energy (a subset of Pumped Hydroelectric Storage) is Subsurface Pumped Hydroelectric Storage. In simple terms, you dig a huge hole, put a plug out of concrete (or other material) in and raise it by pumping water beneath it. When you need energy, you let the plug press the water through turbines which produce energy. It doesn't require a height difference, that's what makes it much more reproducable on a large scale and every environment.  There is a plan to build this on former nuklear powerplant sites in Germany, using the minimaly contaminated concrete that you get when you dismantel those Power Plants. The concrete is not dangerous, but still not allowed for conventional usage. So you achieve two things at the same time. You build a storage for energy and you find a way to dispose all that concrete you'd otherwise had to depose on a landfill. The only study I could find quickly is on the same system but in former coal mines: https://www.rwth-aachen.de/global/show_document.asp?id=aaaaaaaaaagvvyq	0	false	0

The offending industries and their backers try to sow confusion and doubt by denying the claims of the scientific community so that everything is locked in debate and the status quo is maintained. It was pretty effective then and is especially effective now since climate is a much more complex subject than the effects of lead or tobacco smoke on the human body, so it's easier for people to be confused or mislead.

UgxcwL-TZezisOYVj394AaABAg	42billybob	15 hours ago	1535988281287	We already have a non-intrusive industry regulation on food. Nutrition facts & ingredients go on the label. This affects sales organically instead of through subsidies. People aren't actively prevented from producing or consuming food that is bad for you, and no one is forced to pay for a stagnant manufacturer of vile tasting rabbit food no one wants. But there is a definite market demand for food that won't slowly poison your body, or at least a solid balance that does so as little as possible without compromising other demands.  We could impliment something very similar with climate change. Require businesses to stick the carbon footprint on the package of whatever it is they are selling. CO2 produced by the production facility, minus CO2 removed from the atmosphere via any kind of "X% of our profits go towards planting trees" or whatever, divided by units produced. This doesn't even need to be a significant cost to businesses or even taxpayers. Just ballpark it, and as long as you don't advertise under your actual output, you won't get hit with a fraud charge if and when you get audited.  Green is marketable. People will pay more for shit with "green" on the label. The average person wants to do right by the environment. If they're shopping around, and see two equivalent products, but one does less damage to the planet, more likely than not they're going to buy that one... even if it costs a little more. Now suddenly businesses have every incentive to look at every stage in their production, and improve efficiency, minimize CO2 output, and find green alternatives. They'll invest millions into building their own on-site solar farms just to cut the coal power plant out of their carbon footprint they would otherwise have to include by plugging into the grid. All completely of their own volition. And all we had to do was inform the consummer of the currently hidden costs.  Heck, you could probably solve a lot of bad business practices by making that info accessible in-store. A QR code and an online database could put the average layman shopper with a smartphone (basically everyone) in the position to easily find out their purchase might be supporting over-fishing, steroid / animal abuse, ecosystem ravaging pesticide use, or sub-standard wages. Wave the techological marvel in your pocket over the shelf and pick the item that doesn't violate your principles. As opposed to what we have currently where we just have to assume every company is doing evil shit so we may as well just pick the cheapest option unless we want to spend hours doing investigative research & cross compare shell companies well before we even go to the store for every product we buy ever.	0	false	0

UgyoK-piJlXK5wYauDd4AaABAg	JaMoond	16 hours ago	1535984684387	I have a suggestion for your next video. What conservatives contend is the fact that the state intervention in the forms of subsidies and carbon taxes is necessary in order to achieve carbon emission targets and to reduce dependency on hydrocarbon energy. You briefly touched on the subject with your allegory of Freedonia. However, you didn't go far enough in explaining why it is necessary that a government needs to step in to set targets and implement pollution taxes on its citizens to bear the true social cost of polluting the environment. Proponents of free market reject all forms of government intervention, as they believe that government only creates inefficiencies and distortions in the market. To their credit, they are right for the most part. However, market solution cannot exist when the true cost of pollution is faced not by the individual causing the pollution, but by the rest of society especially when it involves shared resources whose property ownership cannot be defined, such as the air that we breathe. This is a concept of externality in the study of economics. In such cases, the only practical solution is a government intervention (i.e. taxing the individuals polluting our shared resources in order to make them bear the true cost of their economic activities, and redirecting the tax revenues into subsidies that can reduce pollution). What you need to do is to justify why government intervention is necessary when free market solution doesn't exist. You can tout all day on the benefits of renewable energy or the science behind global warming. This won't do anyone any good. Conservatives do not see this issue as a matter of sociopolitics or science. They see it as an issue of government infrigemement on free market and individual freedom. Just as fundamentalist Christians use their religious belief as a filter upon which they selectively perceive and interpret science around the theory of evolution to support their conclusion about creationism, conservatives use free market principles to selectively weed out any societal solutions that involve government to fit the narrative of global warming. In order to convince the other side, you have to think like them. Giving a title like "A CONSERVATIVE solution to global warming" without addressing a conservative's true contention about global warming will only drive him away from your views as it is quite condescending. To their credit, free market principle has achieved unparalleled levels of wealth and reduced poverty to historically low levels, and they rightfully believe that free market is the ultimate solution to all societal problems, including global warming. My suggestion is to make a video about why the global warming initiatives such as subsidies and carbon tax is compatible with their idea of free market.	0	false	0

We are reaching a point where capitalism is outdated in many first world countries, as small firms have become highly efficient monopolies, and their efficiency makes it more difficult for small businesses to compete, as the capital necessary to become more efficient is very large. Combine this with the fact that many jobs are becoming automated, and you have quite  the problem. 11:00 The problem here is that more than half of all companies in China are partially state owned with state intervention and funding. It is in no way a free market capitalist country. 19:11 Nobody advocates for living in caves. (I Shouldn't say nobody, but I don't think more than 100 people believe that.) You can advocate for changing the system while not being a primitivist. While I agree that simply blaming capitalism for the problem of climate change is stupid, I don't agree with the idea that capitalism is the best system, especially what it has become in the western world.	1	false	0

Any form of leadership can be corrupted or inneficient, especially those who do not separate the power i.e. Totalitarism(Communism, facism, natzism), dictatures, kingdoms and empires. Also, we are slow to take actions because most of our countries are democracies. You don't get to use someone's money without asking first.  Something being "Worth it" is not all about "make all the money in the world". It's about not waisting ressources on useless shit. It cause more harm than good. As I said: "China is waisting billions on solar, intoxicating its population with coal". The optimal solution, to my eyes, would be to invest all this money in nuclear/hydro, reducing health problem, road maintenance (thousands of non-stop truck loard of coal less) and giving an nice, compact, reliable, cost effective, defendable energy source.	0

UgwgV-rnqFmMQ_WBsUt4AaABAg	Samuel Hovind	16 hours ago	1535984686320	Hey, Potholer54 The way you framed the anti-capitalists could be read as them saying that we should change the economic system solely because it doesn't deal with climate change properly, while in reality capitalism's failure to address and work towards solutions is only one of many critiques of the economic system. I don't think that this is what you meant, but I'd say it's not a fair representation of that side. I don't expect you to make a video on why you don't agree with their arguments, but it would be good if you had added a short sentence about it when you mentioned them. Also, your choice of words makes it seem like you call socialists and other proponents of another economic system for 'extremists' when they bring forwards an honest criticism. You don't have to agree with it and may argue against it, but it's not an 'extreme' position (the word is very heavily negatively charged). You also called them a 'nutty fringe group', and while they are a minority, they consist of solid number of people across the globe, and especially in Western Europe. You also showed pictures of protesters in a time where the opposition to capitalism (and proposition of socialism) was a lot greater than it is today, so calling them 'nutty' and 'fringe' doesn't seem fair, especially then. And while your wording is very uncharitable to them, you seem very charitable to Shapiro and Jillette, even when they are spreading anti-science propaganda and the other group isn't.   Anti-capitalists have good critiques of capitalism's handling of the issue (past, present and future), whether you agree that socialism is the answer or not.	2	false	0

The idea that capitalism is the best facilitator of innovation is absolutely cynical and implies that there is no motive to innovate other than profit, that we cannot possibly do work for the purpose of obtaining the benefits of the products. Capitalism is the reason we have copyright and patents - the poisonous idea that ideas can be owned, and that people should be paid for free copies rather than for their actual work, and that the perfectly natural behavior of imitation should be criminalized. Capitalism may have functioned when people were the best machines, but now thanks to automation, machines are the best machines and the only way to prop up this shitty system is to create more and more fake jobs.	1	false	0

It's impossible to convince them against their religion of "the free market". The only solution is a massive regulatory state and Ben Shapiro knows that.  He's not debating honestly, just shilling.  listen2meokidoki 11 minutes ago (edited) No. It's much more complicated. And the one thing many people refuse to understand is, and this is very simple really, people (aka WE) don't always know what is happening, and can not discover the cause of the many "things" that are happening. And because of the smoke and mirrors, and the usual complexity of the World around us, we often can not find out EXACTLY what is causing things to happen in complicated ways. The more exact, the more difficult. Jumping to conclusions is easy and for many people, very satisfying. And only political people find "not knowing" impossible to stomach. Idiots, like me, are happy not knowing everything, and knowing we will probably never know what caused WW1, or the Big Bang, or the answer to the ultimate question of Life, the Universe and Everything. But what we do (and the Law usually does) is sentence people for breaking the Law regardless of how much they had obeyed the Law and done good things all their life. The political problem of dealing with climate change is who do we blame and how much do we care about other people bearing a (or the) cost. Especially the cost of foregone future profit to the private Owners of the billions of coal/oil deposits that will need to be left in the ground. Maybe owners of coal mines need Patrion to pay them to close their mine.	0	false	0

Many a solar company has teamed up with Chineseâ€™s companies, only to have their tech stolen and go out of business as a result.

UgzJVEjnv8t5j-M-EUt4AaABAg	Probus Excogitatoris	17 hours ago	1535981088155	Using China as an example of the power of capitalism is deeply misleading. China is not a free market and the government plays a vital role in the implementation of renewable energy in China. In fact, one could argue that China is a good example of how strong governmental control is superior to a free market. Entrepreneurs like Huang Ming could never succeed without the blessings and support of the Chinese government. Yes, it makes economic sense and the Chinese government is not stupid. But, China is not an example of the power of capitalism. Quite the opposite. If anything China has highlighted the limits of free markets and democracy. One of the main reasons China has been so successful is because they don't have to respect democratic processes. China is a deeply cynical nation from a political point of view. The fact that human rights are violated on a daily basis and a large portion of China is living below the poverty line just isn't of any major concern to the Chinese government. With that liberty it's not hard to see why China has a huge benefit in comparison to Western democracies who spend a lot of resources on social security, public health care and other projects that benefit the population as a whole. I'm not arguing against democracy or capitalism. I'm just pointing out that your argument is flawed.	7	false	0

First, about 2%   Second, you can't make the claim that the oceans never stopped CO2 climate change, as the climate is not effected by CO2 alone.  How's your day going?  CO2 was listed as a greenhouse gas, by the EPA shortly after Obama took office.  Where did you go to school?  Where you a good boy?  Ya know that Joseph Black a Scottish chemist descovered CO2 in the 1750's?   So its been more that 120 years.  Anyway, we are not in a runaway greenhouse climate.  And finely I said "poisonous" gases spewing from volcanoes, not CO2,  "poisonous".  CO2 is not poisonous, unless inhaled exclusively.

"you can't make the claim that the oceans never stopped CO2 climate change, as the climate is not effected by CO2 alone." But there were several Co2 related cliamte changes in history that where not caused by Sun activity , or areosols or the Milankovitch cycles etc. Why have the oceans not stopped those?? Again in the Jurassic-Cretaceous period we had 10 times higher co2 levels and the oceans did not stop those levels. so why would they suddenly stop now?   "CO2 was listed as a greenhouse gas, by the EPA shortly after Obama took office" so?  the EPA is an independent agency it doesnt decides whats a greenhouse gas and whats isnt. The Scientific communitee and their results do. The EPA could at best decide which greenhouse gas they deem to be  the greatest threat to the enviroment.  "here did you go to school? Where you a good boy? Ya know that Joseph Black a Scottish chemist descovered CO2 in the 1750's? So its been more that 120 years"  Yes thats when he dicovered the Gas... thats its a greenhouse gas  was discovered 120 years ago. See for that "On the influence of carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature of the groundâ€ â€“ Svante Arrhenius, 1896  how did you manage to missunderstood : "CO2 is not a greenhouse gas" ?? it is..Thats something we figured out 120 years ago. But fell free to present a source that it isnt. "??  " we are not in a runaway greenhouse climate." SOURRRRCE please.  " And finely I said "poisonous" gases spewing from volcanoes," Sure , could you please name those  "poisonous" gases that is spewing in higher levels  from volcanoes then from the entire anthropogenic emission? could you also name which one of those "poisonous" gases is a strong climate change driving force or else they are completly irrelevant to this discussion.	0

And the one thing many people refuse to understand is, and this is very simple really, people (aka WE) don't always know what is happening, and can not discover the cause of the many "things" that are happening. And because of the smoke and mirrors, and the usual complexity of the World around us, we often can not find out EXACTLY what is causing things to happen in complicated ways. The more exact, the more difficult. Jumping to conclusions is easy and for many people, very satisfying. And only political people find "not knowing" impossible to stomach. Idiots, like me, are happy not knowing everything, and knowing we will probably never know what caused WW1, or the Big Bang, or the answer to the ultimate question of Life, the Universe and Everything. But what we do (and the Law usually does) is sentence people for breaking the Law regardless of how much they had obeyed the Law and done good things all their life. The political problem of dealing with climate change is who do we blame and how much do we care about other people bearing a (or the) cost. Especially the cost of foregone future profit to the private Owners of the billions of coal/oil deposits that needs to be left in the ground. Maybe owners of coal mines need Patrion to pay them to close their mine.	1

Ugwi5NAb_wA4WB6uhG94AaABAg	Remi	17 hours ago	1535981089868	So I will give two arguments as to why Conservatives (right wing) are not able to tackle climate change. Right wing, because I don't like the term conservative, as they are encompassing people with a lot of different opinions ranging from keynes to smith. Now the way I make the distinction between right and left, is that the left does not think that capitalism is a good economic system and that it needs to be changed... The argument saying that it has given us all the progress we have seen  in recent History is not really an argument, indeed, It has given us this progress at a cost, and we can acknowledge that fact while still being pretty conscious of the cost of this progress... and being able to think of more sustainable ways of organising ourselves. Now there are different economics theories, and ideologies, Capitalism is based on one of them, and criticising it, is criticising an ideology. The left proposes solutions that are based on heterodox economical theories (based on a way of seeing economics outside of the doxa). What is at the bases of capitalism ? The main critic that can be made is that this theory assumes an infinity of resources, in a finite world. Another critics related to climate changes is that capitalism is based on the assumption that humanity needs to accumulate to progress. Progress... in a capitalistic framework, means an increase in GDP. We can imagine another definition for progress, and that's what the left is trying to do. It is also very important to add here that historically all of the social progress are the result of power struggles, deaths sometimes, strikes always... Another side-effect of capitalism under the neoliberal ideology, is that there is a tendency to get rid of regulations because of its idea of free and undistorted competition. Now if we take this definition of Capitalism... It is very much impossible to conceive a solution to global warming in today's context without relying on technologies that don't already exist (which is a gamble). In this context the only way to tackle climate change is to decrease or be a lot more efficient in what we do, and that means regulating the market, capping the amount of flight trip anyone can make, putting CEOs in jail for polluting the air or the water, limiting the amount of cars that one can buy, all of which is not compatible with a capitalistic view. Example : It makes sense to have a free trade agreement between Japan and Europe in a capitalistic context... However, increasing transactions between Japan and Europe is not compatible with tackling Climate change (is it that hard to grasp that ?). Moreover, I do think that we are passed the time when regulations can accommodate people and be convenient for most of the population... It is now time to put in place "inconvenient" regulations (once again regulations are in contradiction with the current view of the capitalist ideology), that is if we really want to tackle climate change... But I don't think we actually do. Therefore, there cannot be any long term solution to climate change if we stay in this system, which is defended by right wing politics. Some of us think/hope that the transition can be planned... Some of us think that we will need to have a big fat civil war/revolution (that's were the left basically separate itself).  You might have noted that i don't really put social democratic politics in the left camp... there are historical reasons for that, but I don't really want to go into details here. Cheers.	0	true	2

Ugzbbn-pDEV2__HdggF4AaABAg	Resarek	17 hours ago	1535981089903	Oil replaced coal largely about a century ago and that was a vast improvement for the environment of the time.  Capitalism will ultimately provide the solution but it will be a solution where someone makes money.  We all want money and a solution and we will pay for that solution or we will come up with it.  Government is simply a middleman in the equation and a loud blustering one that offers no solutions, turns the problem in to a catastrophe for votes and power, decreases understanding of the science (because they rarely understand or read more than the cliff notes and never have an in depth understanding).  So why not skip all that crap and start coming up with solutions, not too long ago recycling was rare, until it was made economically feasible.   The biggest issue with most of the green crowd is that their solutions only solve one part of the problem and leave people worse off.  We may not like coal as an energy source but what about the miners, and the power plant workers?  Did you offer to retrain them and rehire them to build or maintain wind mills?  No that's where the green crowd wants capitalism to come in so they can save money for their other initiatives that they care about.  This is an even bigger issue in the developing world.  The other crazy thing is that the green crowd want to run straight to renewables  without intermittent clean energy like nuclear (which has a smaller carbon footprint than solar even) or hydropower that could solve many things quicker and more effectively.  The fact that renewables are in play at all is only due to government subsidies.  So yay we get to pay twice.	0	false	0

UgyrG_v9BPGusezSHfJ4AaABAg	Brendhan Horne	17 hours ago	1535981089949	A comment I posted on Facebook to a friend who linked to the video.  As usual an excellent video by potholer54. He glosses over some very significant points in development issues, particular to changes in attitude and products (the lead gas one is a big one). However I understand why he did.   However when he points out that  the issues on subsidies he misses the mark on corporate subsidies (specifically in the US, not necessarily on a global economy). Particular to the oil companies.   He misses the mark on utilities that have literally made it so difficult to add solar panels to a home that it has set us back even further.  The conservative attitude also says that tax subsides shouldn't exist except for their particular company. Then helps fuel the agenda on how tax payers pay too much in taxes, the government over regulates, and none of that tax money is going to have a benefit for the tax payer in 24 hours.   Peter sort of misses the point the US conservative agenda is not what it use to be and how it does not resemble the idea of responsible government. He mentions a can do attitude we have lost, but that wasn't a conservative value. The EPA was made an official organization by Nixon after the reaction to the silent spring. Lord cheeto has been removing the protections implemented by the EPA.   When the West Virginia water  was poisoned everyone knew the company tanks that leaked into the water. The company suffered no real consequences.  When the tanks blew up and basically destroyed a Texas town. The company did not bear the brunt of the penalties.   Coal mining still fights regulation to the extent that black lung disease has reappeared in workers.  So while I understand what Peter is saying and I agree with him in principal. The American conservative agenda has become a detriment to the United States. Which is I understand what Peter is saying, but when he holds the Asian economy up as a principal example. He is glossing over the travesty of pollution issues that have been and still are a huge part of the Asian economy.   We do not import certain pet foods or toys because of recent issues with lead and toxic items found in these items. The issues with honey imports alone are scary enough.   The ban on these things did not happen because conservatives said hey this is bad. The ban happened because liberals said I don't want to buy food that will kill my cat. And the conservatives said don't buy the food, the free market will fix it. Not caring that most people may not have that ability or choice.  Regulations are in many ways good for the economy, too many would be very bad but the conservatives in the US now hold the idea that if my pig farm poisons your water supply, you should move.	2	false	0

The consequences of climate change on many of the poorest in the world and the total blindness of centrist capitalists both to these phenomena, the reality that democracy, as limited as it was, has fallen pray to the inevitable forces of capitalist POWER and the imminent danger the culmination of these factors along with the great potential of A.I. and concentrating industrial capability in the hands of fewer and fewer people have to create greater poverty, starvation, suicide and ultimately financial manslaughter and ultimately potentially a massive increase in capitalist murder and genocide by many means, climate change being only one of many.   Just looking at Trump and nobody can tell me capitalism is a success,.  Comparing  Russia before the revolution to before the dismantling of the Soviet, and for its terrible failings, no country developed faster and against all the odds, every capitalist imperialist country attacked them and we thought they were the threat!

Ugz5fBekWb2lL0AVwLt4AaABAg	Anon McAnon	17 hours ago	1535981090044	I completely agree with what you have to say, but China has an ulterior motive in the solar-game.  They control the vast majority of current rare earth element mining operations. REEs are a critical component in the production of solar panels, dynamos for wind and hydro power and much more.  In addition to them controlling most of the world's current supply (only about a third of the world's total supply) another issue with REEs in tech is the immense pollution that results from mining them.  I agree that we need a new solution, but we need to make sure we don't screw ourselves over. Most people aren't even aware of the pollution caused by solar-panel production or that China may not be the best country to have your power-grid rely on. They've tried threatening countries with cut-offs before, and if global dependence on REEs increases they may have more leverage to use next time. The US already stopped mining for REEs due to pollution to boot.  This is a complex situation.	0	false	0

Also I will add that not all who are in the intersection of those who criticize capitlaism and want to do something about global warming want to halt or even revert technological progress( most in fact want new techy to replace fossil fuels)  I'm taking myself as an example, I criticize capitalism for it's inability  to transition into industry 2.0 without creating a massive unemployable underclass while also supporting that the solution is a networked resource based economy (In terms of energy for example I'm a staunch supporter of nuclear energy as newe3r reactor designs and the increasing viability of fusion could replace all other energy sources within a decade). Instead of halting or reverting progress it's better to fully embrace, or even accellerate it, to acheive a type 1 civilisation.	3	false	0

Nuclear energy has shown that it has the potential to decarbonise electricity production, France is a clear example.

That might work if we limit that to non-physical things or we have 100% efficient recycling, exept we also need more humans till infinity as there are limits on how much a person can consume. But as it is today, the more the better and exploiting something so much that it becomes rare makes that thing even more valuble. So now its even a bigger reason to exploit that until it don't exist. That is unless we can replace this with an cheaper alternative so we expolit that as much as we can then go over to the next alternative and so on.

They had no factories to filter out uranium isotopes, no factories to make plutonium, no idea on how to reliably detonate it, NOTHING except an idea, some fear, and determination. Several hundreds of thousands of people working on this project alone - on something that was a little more than science fiction at that time. And their fear? They feared that the dying rotten corpse that was Hitler might have it first, even when all of their resources were spread thin in many wars started by that overconfident corpse.

If we could just solve the issue that any storage medium, whether it's batteries, water reservoirs, compressed air, or whatever, have a capacity, that'd go a long way to turning this around...as in find something that is just so good at absorbing then giving back energy later as to make current batteries obsolete.

The underlying driving force (profit) of capitalism is what caused global warming in the first place, as did the machinery of capitalism (i.e. industrialism). 3. There is a huge difference between replacing ingredients in a product (e.g. lead, CFCs) and replacing the product itself. 4. It still takes lots of fossil fuels to make renewable energy technologies. Not to mention all the toxic and rare earth minerals that go into solar panels, for example. 5. China isn't "free enterprise". Most of the research there is government directed and controlled. 6.

The problems arise, not from manufacturing and engineering, nor any other goods and services, but from the way banking, finance and the stock market are being run, where wealth can be created that has no connection with actual goods and services, allowing people to get very rich taking the 'nothing money' of future investments, and the robbery of ordinary wage earners through share dividends and buying up of company stocks creating more 'nothing money' from artificially inflating the value of said corporations.  Democratic Socialists do not want to destroy capitalism, they want wealth inequality reduced - Although capitalism can produce good research into solving problems, government research is very good at producing research for new technology too, the Apollo missions were hardly exercises in capitalism.

Solar and wind have mathematical limits, ie there's only so much energy a particular patch of land can ever produce with those. You'd need a shitton of land to power all of civilization with it and increasing distances and the size of the facility makes it even less efficient and more labor intensive so the problem becomes worse. Its a non-solution  There's no need to come up with a solution when a better one already exists. Nuclear power. A ton of uranium contains as much energy as 6 million tons of coal. In other words, we can get our energy out of uranium using only an insignificant fraction of the resources we need to get it by any other means.  Its incredibly clean too. It produces no greenhouse gases and only a very manageable amount of solid waste that can be stored pretty safely.	0	false	0

Of course you can argue that there's no evidence that a non-capitalist system would have reacted any faster, which is true because it's impossible to know and all "what ifs" are based on conjecture. And of course it doesn't matter now anyway, since what's done is done. I would however like to argue against the notion that leftists want to plunge society back into the pre-industrial age; just like capitalism isnâ€™t incompatible with science and technological advancement, neither is communism. And much of science and research and development is already being done outside of the free market so I don't see why the free market is necessary for developing new technologies. Isn't the wish to have better quality of life enough of a motivation to develop better tech? Why does there need to be a profit motive?

UgyL8XIH7uljpQpFnpR4AaABAg	White Templar	20 hours ago	1535970297719	Climate change has been occurring without human intervention for as long as the Earth has had a climate. Heating and cooling cycles are a natural part of Earth's existence. The amount humans contribute to the current heating pattern is negligible at best. This does not, however, mean we should not try to fight pollution of all kinds for more philosophical reasons. Plant a tree not because they are the most effective way to sequester CO2, but because some of the greatest moments in life are when you connect with nature. Don't push for renewable energy over fossil fuels because fossil fuels produce a lot of CO2, but because renewable energy is ultimately going to be a necessity and early adoption is always the most profitable in more ways than one. Too often do we miss the forest for the trees. Many see only symptoms, but not the root causes. Our problem isn't as simple as pollution, it goes far deeper. Culture and philosophy are our true issues. Globalism ignores the environment of wherever the cheapest labor is, poisoning not only the Earth there, but undoubtedly many of the products as well(see farmed fish). Rampant consumerism; nothing lasts forever and that is a problem(considering that most items and certainly the packaging ends up in a landfill and not a recycling facility, this is an issue. Not only is the product waste pollution, but not recycling is a highly inefficient use of materials). Ignorance is bliss(what I mean by this is that most people these days know literally nothing about nature, some of which claim to be experts. Many spend their whole lives in concrete jungles, maybe going out into "nature" to snowboard or surf, but ultimately neither understanding nor having a connection with the natural world.) Our society is ultimately one of sickness. A failure by philosophical standards.	0	false	0

You are saying (if i understand you correctly) that there are pro-capitalists decline the solutions to global warming because anti-capitalists propose the solutions and that the solutions that anti-capitalists propose are intertwined with non-capitalist models or with the fight against capitalism. And here i will agree. You are also saying (if i understand you correctly) that anti-capitalists are unfair in stating that capitalism is unable to find solutions. And here i agree with you as well. But then your conclusion is that the correct solution to the problem is with a "free market" model. And here you are committing a logical fallacy. Just because many anti-capitalists are incorrect when they say that capitalist model is unable to find the solution, does not mean that if such a solution were found (and it is found) then we as the society must choose that one.  Now, it is possible that you are simply stating this as your opinion or your proposal. In that case, i will simply say that i disagree with you, but at this moment i am willing to temporarily put that difference aside and work with you on resolving this huge problem... as long as neither one of us actively blocks attempts of another. So yes, you can work towards subsidising companies that would create a cleaner alternative energies and make them feasible for current world and increasing the costs of pollution through some sort of fines, but i should be able to in parallel to work on conservation, "really really free markets", and increasing the cost of pollution through direct action.	0	false	0

Please understand this is done with the most amount of respect and reverence for everything you have done to promote science around global warming.  You miss-understand the argument against capitalism. The argument is not that the usage of money as a medium of the exchange of goods and services can't be used to solve global warming. Of course it can in an ideal world, where everyone in properly informed about the issues and understand the science. We don't live in that world. In this world, the world we actually live in, it is more short term profitable to companies to simply deny global warming exist and pay off law maker to agree with this.   Because from a capitalist perspective, paying off politicians and buying propagandists to spread miss information is simply an investment, and the reward is favorable law, loose regulation, which results in an increase in profit. There is nothing within capitalism that prevent this tactic. By the time the consequences rolls around, the rich would have made enough money. While the few are the only ones reaping the benefits, the consequence will be share by all. In fact, this is the core tenet of capitalism, privatize the gains, socialize the losses. And this is the capitalism we are against.   So if you can find a way to prevent this tactic, and make companies bear the whole social cost of their activities, then we would be fine with that system. Whatever that system is called, it is certainly not how capitalism is working right now.   I hope you will no longer use this straw-man argument in your next video.	0	false	0

Re the point you made about Freedonia and externalised costs of CO2 pollution, the there was a great paper published in World Development in 2016 that studied the implicit and explicit subsidies that the fossil fuel industry enjoys. They concluded that it benefits from total subsidies of 6.5% of total global GDP, or $5.3 trillion EVERY YEAR. If this money was instead ploughed into building out clean energy production, storage and distribution, this problem would be solved within a matter of years. Just imagine what you could do with a $50 trillion!

Capitalism is "fine" when it's dealt with the goal of bettering society, when the express goal of the regulatory bodies is to phase capitalism out through its own power, by the same logic that we had to start with fossil fuel derived energy to manufacture the first solar panels.    Let's take China, a country with a communist leadership that uses capitalism with the goal to develop the material conditions to eventually do away with it and reach the second stage of socialism.	0	false	0						
UgxtGzouesXWBQKCgNN4AaABAg	FutureShock9	21 hours ago	1535966700091	Potholer, I don't think you're accurately representing "the left" here. Climate denial is part of the conservative orthodoxy in the US (you've shown plenty of clips to this effect), but I'm not sure there's even one senator/media pundit who's claimed they want to end capitalism, and among the activists who do, I can't think of any who propose ending civilization along with it. Most anti-capitalists would agree with the reforms you suggest, just with more of an emphasis on workers' rights (say what you will about China's green-tech, they still treat workers pretty poorly).  Government subsidies & tax credits are explicitly anti-free-market solutions, so I'm not sure why you're so quick to present cave-dwelling as the only alternative to capitalism. When fossil fuel companies bribe legislators to kneecap solar & wind, that's capitalism run amok. When fracking tycoons fund PragerU's misinformation campaigns, that's capitalism run amok. Blaming capitalism is a perfectly reasonable conclusion when private investors consistently fail to make good long-term decisions and use every underhanded tactic available to get away with it.	4	false	0

The majority of people on the green side are just as nutty, and in my mind, much worse than the global warming deniers. The three windmills I saw, turning on Saturday, and ironically at rest on Sunday, are three monuments erected to remind us of green absurdities.  The three windmills were erected on flat land, prime land, in the bottom of a valley. We know both through science and experience that there is not much wind in such valleys because a temperature inversion essentially holds the air in the valley. Most valleys in the area only have anabatic and katabatic winds: useless for power production, but this valley does, unfortunately for the residents it turns out, enjoy some prevailing wind - but not much. Enough apparently to find the political motivation to erect three hulking giants but not enough to make them pay for themselves.  So we, the public, are paying, every day more tax than we need to. They were never a good idea scientifically, economically, aesthetically or environmentally. It's a political win in the minds of the greens but in fact has only provided their opponents more arms to fight their side and has left the taxpayer's wallet bleeding and the residents with a blemish on their otherwise beautiful countryside.  Potholer54, you are preaching to the wrong side.

UgyO_82pKy5fgKM0ABh4AaABAg	sgg	21 hours ago	1535966701690	You tripped before the finish line on storage.  Sure, you can store energy using weights, but steel and lead are only about 8 and 11 times denser than water respectively, only storing that much more per volume at a given height. The cost, both in terms of energy and money, would be far more than water. There's also scalability to be considered. There's a reason water is by far the most common method of storage. Batteries also suffer from the same and, as you touched on, hot salt storage only lasts a few hours. The development required in battery technology is nowhere in sight. "Rolling up our sleeves" to develop the required grid-level storage technologies, which aren't even at the conceptual phase as far as I know, is only required if we insist on particular inferior generation technologies. Intermittency isn't just an issue of inconvenience, but stability. Large numbers of intermittent generators reintroduces the problem of subsynchonous resonance, which can damage or destroy generators, motors, and other equipment connected to the grid. The Mohave Generating Station suffered two shaft failures in the 70s as a result of SSR. The only technology that has delivered cheap, clean, and dependable power at the grid level is nuclear. France gets about 75% of its electricity from its reactors and has emissions and electricity costs a fraction of its neighbors. And this is with reactors that are the equivalent of wood-burning steam cars in the nuclear world. We've had better designs since at least the 60s. The only reason France and the rest of the world still uses steam cars is because of regulations with no basis in reality.These regulations are the product of lobbying by pseudo environmentalists who have been lying to the public about nuclear power and radiation for decades. Nearly everything is radioactive to some degree, the linear-no-threshold model of radiation exposure is pseudoscience, you can't make nuclear weapons from reactor grade material, and nuclear power has a lower death toll than any other method by orders of magnitude.	0	false	0

Ugx7l44Ya4Cn3mK6qNR4AaABAg	Xavier Lusby	21 hours ago	1535966701727	Thatcher successfully tanked the UK economy, and used oil as a huge source of income for the UK. You also LOVE to leave out the part where government bodies PASS LAWS BANNING THINGS FORCING PRIVATE ENTERPRISE TO INNOVATE. That isn't a natural process of "Scientists discover something is bad, so society naturally begins phasing it out". Businesses have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the drawing board of solutions after government law is enacted banning said negative thing, often after years of politicians bitching about how it constrain the free market. Furthermore, you don't seem to realize exactly how much money is thrown at politicians in the US by large oil companies to insulate them from policies that could empower solar, and force them to compete or take on adoption costs. Solutions for global warming can be done within the capitalist system and likely will be eventually, but this requires regulation of the free market to discourage the use of fossil fuels at a minimum, and will be fought and delayed as long as possible by wealthy interests through bribes both under and over the table. And frankly, Thatcher's general disdain for necessary regulation is largely responsible for a legacy of push-back against climate conscious politics, which has taken stronger roots in the US than anywhere else. And while the president's piss poor excuses  are just that, China's clean energy boom would be a lot more impressive if they weren't still driving up emissions. https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2018/07/01/china-emits-more-carbon-dioxide-than-the-u-s-and-eu-combined/#4f409490628c or weren't just generally ruining their own arable land through pollution. Capitalism creates an environment where bad behavior is rewarded, and legislation that can prevent it can be blocked if you know the right palms to grease. This doesn't make forward progress impossible, but it causes push-back against progress, which in turn leads to anti-scientific claptrap being introduced into and proliferating in the political sphere as a reaction and defense against change. Not all Conservatives are the same, and you are thankfully in the saner sphere, but talking utter bollocks and ad hominem attacks against your political opponents can fuck right off. I'll agree to disagree on the role of capitalism in influencing climate change legislation if I have to; but sitting here getting slandered pisses me right the fuck off, not to mention watching someone I valued as genuine actively distort the facts by omission to bolster their position.	0	false	0

Regarding capitalism, I feel this video is made with the spirit of just keeping going on vacation by flight and incisting that we should just come up with a â€greenâ€ way to fuel the tanks, instead of actually not taking vacation by flight at all in the meantime. I get that man donâ€™t like changes, but when I hear people preaching the splendour of capitalism and that technological advances will save the word, I believe itâ€™s sometimes an argument out of convinience.   Of course you can find examples where the capitalist system has produced something like the solar park in China you mention. But as long short term profit is king, those examples will just be the exceptions that define the rule.   As for Thatcher, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair to just present her as a person who is just so smart that she always went with the science. She was a politician and we all know those two doesnâ€™t always hold hands.

UgzBCC9foVXwxR_VehZ4AaABAg	Lyn Potter	22 hours ago	1535963101808	I always enjoy a good history lesson, especially when it's a tragedy.  But I do have to object to your characterization of the 'Capitalism is not the answer' crowd.  I happen to have recently been reading up on some of them.  They don't want to take the world back to living in caves.  There's still a desire for 'progress.'   The difference is only in the method of getting there.  Whereas you champion a free market approach, they contend that this has been the approach of the last half-century and it simply isn't enough.  It could have been, had Carter's journey caught on, but we chose not to do it.  In other words, the free market COULD solve this, but the free market WON'T solve this.  Even China/Germany/Australia/Norway are still responsible for too much emissions for us to not cook ourselves.  What they don't burn themselves, they sell off to be burned elsewhere.  Thus, their desire is both punish those who contribute to emissions (which will trickle down to everyone, undoubtedly) and to boost those who decrease emissions through the use of renewable energy.  This isn't radically different from free market solutions in concept, but it is much stricter in practice.  The very act of picking winners and losers is incompatible with the free market...which is not to say it doesn't already happen when the powers that be wish it to.    Unfortunately, not only has that proven impossible, but we still can't even agree not to poison water sources in the name of unnecessary energy extraction.  In the U.S., fracking is still exempt from the most relevant environmental laws.  The turn around that is possible with the free market has not happened and is not getting closer to happening.   There's no need to get rid of capitalism entirely, but it is not going to fix this problem for us.  Much like healthcare, the financial incentives to not fix the problem are much greater than the humanitarian incentives to do so...as long as you can convince yourself that the climate won't be too bad in your lifetime.	0	false	0

UgyO2_yJTHfzmhbVSZp4AaABAg	Timothy Musson	22 hours ago	1535963103289	The typical capitalist expectation is that the market will create a solution to any problem it creates (never mind mass extinctions - they're irrelevant), there's no rational alternative to this way of doing things, and if we all just shut up and go along with it everything will be fine. An entrepreneur or breakthrough will save us in the nick of time, because that's the way it's going to work. This is guaranteed and unquestionable. And it is magical thinking. The fact is, CO2 emissions need to plummet right now (not later), and we need to shift our focus from consumerism and war to keeping the planet habitable. That means a level of austerity that doesn't mesh with the consumer lifestyles our kind of capitalism demands and depends on, vastly complicated by the way politics is influenced by corporations.

I am not a climate change denier. But the single most useful source of power is nuclear energy. Dangerous? You bet! But solar and wind power is completely ineffective for our needs. I find it hilarious that liberals and leftists swear by the science of climate change but completely scoff at human biology. Transgenderism is a proven mental disorder.  The leftists blame anthropogenic climate change as the source of the horrible fires here in California. Wrong! It was "environmental" laws that protect "old growth forests" and woodland creatures such as the spotted owl that have allowed these fires. During the gold rush a huge amount of deforestation took place in the Sierras for manufacturing, railroads, and basic heat. There are very few "old growth" forests anywhere now. And the actual amount of trees is more than ever. But because of reckless regulation, our forests are overgrown with underbrush and deadfall. That is the tinder for these huge fires. Add that most farmers and landowners cannot perform controlled burns (a practice used for centuries) worsens the problem.  The believers that governments can control the climate is laughable. Oh yeah the Paris Accord was brilliant! Make American tax payers foot the bill, while China and India (two of the world's greatest polluters) have to change basically nothing. Stop with the "Blame American First" bullshit!  Go ahead, if driving around in your Prius makes you feel better fine. But don't give me some crap that you're helping save the planet because you aren't. An efficient gas or diesel engine has a far less impact on the environment than an electric car. The manufacture and "recycling" of batteries is horrendous and caustic. Not to mention you still need electricity....hmm. That electricity isn't coming from wind and solar power!   Did you sanctimonious Prius owners realize your bumpers are made out of the modern equivalent of styrofoam???? Take a look! You vilified and eliminated most styrofoam coffee cups but now your vehicle has the equivalent of a thousand or so coffee cups!  Instead of reliance on an inefficient and corrupt government, how about some personal responsibility? We don't need a plastic straw ban! I've used the same Big Gulp plastic cup and straw for over a year now. Wash it out every day, perfect! What most people just don't get is that the government wants to punish you for your part in climate change, because it's a huge money-making machine. And all in the guise of virtue. If you really think Al Gore with his several homes, Lear-jets, armed personnel, etc. plays by the same principles he preaches, I can't help you.

South Australia currently has the world's largest lithium-ion battery for their new wind farm. These are made by Tesla and it was $50 million. Chemical batteries are one of those things that you can't really make cost effectively unless you're making them on stupidly large scales. Not many projects like this exist and so the batteries for them are one-off products and massively expensive.  They're looking at the market as it is now and basing their approach off what's available now. As opposed to trying to mould the market into solving a particular problem. Solar and wind with storage is great for rural areas but they're not the sort of thing you're going to be powering New York off. Chemical batteries of that scale are just too expensive and other energy storage approaches are very situational. That might change if you force the market into developing cheaper, more efficient, large scale chemical batteries but conservatives don't operate like that. In their view it's not the government's job to control the economy to adapt to government policy and rather they need to adapt government policy to the current economic reality.	0

It would have been refreshing to hear the warning coming from the last place expected â€” from a conservative icon.   She gave that speech in 1989, and was out of power just over a year later.

A small point, but a relevant one. Her minarchism is actually compatible with policies to mitigate global warming, since it involves infringements on private property rights and that's almost all that she thought the state should do.  (2) Capitalism /= taxation and subsidies for certain things, in the ordinary usage of the word "capitalism". Ronald Reagan (and almost every other Republican/British Conservative) supported agricultural subsidies, for various reasons. One obvious reason is national defence: if there's a global conflict that greatly disrupts food imports, can one's country mitigate the problems via domestic production? If not, it's a national security issue. Similarly, global warming creates all sorts of national security risks (global conflicts, mass migrations, natural disasters etc.) and so subsidies can make sense. Unless you're going to argue that Ronald Reagan wasn't a "capitalist", in which case you're not even disagreeing with everyone else when they say "capitalism is compatible with science".  (3) "Conservative" is obviously ambiguous, but for the overwhelming majority of the English-speaking world, Thatcherism is definitely a kind of conservativism.	0

I disagree that Reagan and thatcher were conservatives in that sense (their policies showed otherwise).   For Ayn Rand, you are correct, she is no anarcho-capitalist but she did advocate for the separation of the State from Economics and the complete dismantling of the regulatory systems that govern the market as it is the case for the separation of State and religion. I don't get how her philosophy is compatible with policies to mitigate global warming.   Currently fuel industries are lobbying congress to get subsidies to protect their off-shore drilling sites against global warming while at the same time lobbying them to cut regulations on carbon emissions and toxic waste!  That been said, science by its nature is collective, incremental, creative, and publicly accessible. Science thrives when it is subsidized by the people (tax payer money), the developed world is a prime example of that, and it dies when it is controlled by private corporations and monopolies (currently the third world).	1

I would of made a video myself but I donâ€™t have resources/following to make it worthwhile.  The biggest test to dealing climate change is having faith in humanity. Scientists will have solved climate change way before left and right wing political advocates will. The left and right wing politically minded are only interested in following indoctrinated self-centred dogmatic rhetoric, blame shifting, retaliation, elitism, and both despite their claims of innocence are both with their short-sighted narrow mindedness and close mindedness actually making the problem worse.   The IPCC stated that population and GDP are the biggest drivers of global warming.  Global Warming isn't even the worst problem, water scarcity is!   "Cowspiracy" is pseudo-science money scam filled with mistruth and narrow-minded vegan "moral superiority" prejudice. There is lots of sugar, carbohyrates and starch in vegan diets so vegan diets aren't 100% healthy.   Vegans and the media love to dumb down the facts and bash poor farmers, yet farms account for only maybe 10% of greenhouse gases. Most greenhouse gases come from the cities. Americans use five times more energy and resources and have an astronomical amount of national debt compared to other countries. CO2 lasts in the atmosphere about 300 years, methane lasts about 15 years in the atmosphere. There is about 4000 times more CO2 in the atmosphere than methane.  Electric motors aren't the "be all and end all" technology than the elitist regressive Left and the technocratic crony capitalist controlled media wants you to believe. Algae farms are being researched for food, biofuel, bioreactors, building materials, ink, texiles/clothes, space exploration science projects, cleaner waterways, CO2 recapture, and to supercede over 900 fossil fuel based products. Algae is nature's greenhouse filter and provide about 50% of the world's photosynthesis. Support our important agricultural industry so important for every country's financial future and national security. It is critical for our own best interests to develop back up alternative power and food supplies, and avoid "greenwash" industry monopolies.  What is everyone's problem and what is wrong with them? Everyone is pretending to be someone they are not, and underneath is it just sad!      Cheer up, and stop being so nasty to people you have never met before, it's not the end of the world, you miserable fucks!  No one owns a monopoly on the truth!	0	false	0

That is what we are voting for when we elect our representatives.   There is no "natural" free market.  The most powerful market participants will set the rules of the game. Governments must take responsibility for their role in defining the rules of the market. Voters in democracies should understand the power of government in setting the rules for markets.  Their voting decisions should follow accordingly.   Why would you vote for a government which wants to relinquish its responsibilities and says "let 'the market' decide"?

UgwI7cnV60EiiRl8SBB4AaABAg	technatezin	1 day ago	1535955913206	Fairly detailed video on what would an attempted conservative free market solution to the problem of global warming would look like, but it also has its share of problems which include things like:  1. global problems that affect the whole planet will necessarily mean the solution will have to be global in scope. Capitalism, unfortunately discourages this because its a system that is dependent on mutually hostile competition between countries and among different competing businesses within countries to function and keep prices low for potential customers. Having one country exporting renewable energy products isn't going to work to solve the problem of global warming when countries on the other side of the world continue to use polluting non-renewable energy products and infrastructure. Further, a few (one or two) companies being able to produce and sell reliable and high efficiency green technology products because of patents protecting their trade secrets would mean poorer customers opting to buy less expensive products from companies using old polluting technologies would still very likely do just that which makes the green tech. products sold on the market by companies cornering the market on green energy technology a tiny niche market for those who could afford to pay the premium for green products. In other words, it would contribute very little to solving the global warming problem and make environmentally friendly "green" products little more than a way for middle class people to virtue signal as someone who cares about the environment.  2. The market is fundamentally incompatible with manufactured products which has a long functional life for the customer who purchase them. High volume of sales or high retail price for the product sold on the market translates into high profitability for the business which developed and owns the rights to the product. There's no financial incentive for any private profit seeking company to develop a product that could be sold once to a customer and could be used by that same customer for many years without the product being worn out, used up or malfunctioning in any way. If the business selling environmentally friendly products which would include things like solar panels is to be profitable and survive in the market then the product sold would either have to be sold at such a high price that it becomes a super expensive luxury item on the luxury niche market or it would have to be sold as low quality cheaply made items in the mass market which would inevitably mean they would experience frequent malfunctions, so they need to be thrown away and the customer making a repeat purchase of the same low quality product. Neither incentivized behavior for the consumer in this situation is environmentally friendly or sustainable. For any customer to afford the pricey luxury items that are considered to be "environmentally friendly" many hours of economic activity (possibly polluting activity) in our present economic system as represented by the accumulated money needed for the purchase of the item would need to be performed. For mass produced low quality items with a high frequency of expected malfunction or expected maintenance the problem of attempting to be environmentally friendly in that situation is obvious.  3. The elephant in the room which nobody is really willing to acknowledge and talk about is population growth and the ever growing demands on the limited resources of the Earth that implies. Capitalism actually incentivizes a growing population as that increases the possibility of greater sales revenue for the products sold on the marketplace. Whether those products sold is "green" or not is irrelevant. What is important is sales revenue which in turns increases the amount of profit returned to investors by a profit seeking business. The problem with a growing population from an ecological perspective is obvious. You will reach a point where the growth in the human population will outstrip the amount of physical resources necessary to sustain that population, however from the perspective of private business which only sees the potential for increased sales revenue that a bigger population will bring, forecasting or anticipating the inevitable resource usage overshoot and crash is a waste of time because it doesn't affect private businesses bottom line in the short term.	0	false	0

UgxGWKBqfhXUrT31FEp4AaABAg	Johnny Jones	1 day ago	1535955913249	I am officially a climate sceptic. Not because I donâ€™t believe in the science. I am skeptical to the degree of the rate of change. Just like the drug pharmaceutical company for example it has become very political, money orientated at the expense of peopleâ€™s health. With the lack of transparency and accountability. Not that I don't trust the drugs will work just skeptical which drugs I should be taking and the side effects that they claim or lack of claims. Basically I no longer trust this system to do what is right and ethical. This culture has changed in my opinion to the worse has and is going backwards every year.  But I do agree with this clip 110%. As I was extremely sceptical and did strongly disagreed with some of your last clips. Especially with suspicious observer. All I witnessed was obvious point scoring without any real discussions about his theories.  I am an Australian and even though I have no idea what you are going to say in part 2. Let me give you some of my OPINION regarding the Australian political system. When Julia Gillard became Prime Minister she won with the promise that she was not going to introduce any form of Carbon tax. This was one of her leading policy that led her to a win. Without it she might have lost as it was a very close election. When she won and she went against one of her fundamental promises (Carbon Tax). This was not what the majority of voters wanted. This action further increase the distrust in politics and the environmental cause. She went on the publicity compaign (spent big dollars on adverts) to try to explain to the Australian voters why she didn't break her election promise. It wasn't a Carbon Tax but Carbon Trading. (She tried to convince the public that she didn't break her promise as it wasn't a new Tax) All we heard was that the voter did not get what we wanted, a new tax was being introduce under another weasel defintion and suspected that bankers and politicians where going to profit and the average Australian was going to lose. To my satisfaction by popular demand it was dumped. And I am glad it did, as governments are hopless at introducing anything. More so now than ever. We built the Sydney Habour Bridge in the 1920's and the Snowy mountain hydro electric in the 1940's system and both are still going strong. Nowdays things have changed. As for example.  This same government Labor (to the left) decided to introduce NBN. Intially all drawn up at the back of a paper napkin.(Internet via fibre optics) Promised to be the future of Australia and launch them into prosperity and the beacon for other countries to follow. As countries like japan where decades ahead and without such investments we would be left behind. They promised it would lead to new jobs and discoveries even though they did not know what they were. Basically a promise of a dream of hope and change. (build it and they will come) obviously with the best intent but ended up being a total disaster. Over budgeted by billions and continually going up. Constant project delays. They started to take short cut to reduce cost by reducing the scope. Instead of fibre to the house it went down to fibre to nodes. They legislated that all existing competitors to be bought out/compensated to only allow one government carrier. No freedom of choice or alternatives. They are removing all copper lines. So if you just want a telephone line only. As they would still work if there was a power outage or disasters. Great for the elderly as they are the most vulnerable and do not know how to use mobile phones. You no longer have that choice. Complaints by customers who were forced to move to the NBN have sky rocketed slower connection than what they had before or no service. Unfortunately there is nothing customers can do as now there are no alternatives. Only NBN.  In Sydney Australia about 10yrs ago our dams was virtually empty. We went thru hush water restrictions. Governments, scientists and media claimed it was climate changed and drastic action was required. It was claimed it was the new normal. We spent billions on a desalination plant all on the claim we needed water security. (the skeptics called it bottled electricity) Our water rates went up to cover the cost. Once it was completed the rain came down (mind you it did rain in Sydney before hand just not where the dams where located) and our dams have been so full ever since still to this day. And so much rain that we have to release water so it doesn't overflow. Is been this way for years now. The desalination plant was decommissioned. We had to pay penalties to the French provider for not using it more than 10yrs. The parts were sold to the Russians for a fraction of the price it was built for. And our water rates never went down.  Yes there a cheats and hack but we still donâ€™t have an efficient way of storing electricity. Till this is solved we will still be fossil fuel dependant.   In short. I do not share your faith in any politics, corporation or media in this current state. Until we go back to old fashion values where there are full transparencies and accountabilities. I am sceptical to any policies that anyone tries to implement.  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me	0	true	3

They're interested in turning profit quick, to the hell with spill over costs, or society. I got mine, therefore fuck you; mentality. A dirty Ayn Rand greed is somehow a virtue nonsense.  And the con jobber Milton Friedman idiot supply side economics. Thus we have the return to robber baron oligarchy to the point it's no different between absolute monarchy, or any other tyrannical state.  Conservatives in the US use the gullible rubes, not ironic that they're usually the most superstitious prone to Alex Jones and their own fantasy nuttery pull whatever out of your ass so called conspiracy, and various religions... the conservative politicians know this and use this to gather them up for votes.  And you have 3rd world conditions in Georgia (the state, not the country) being investigated by the UN for raw sewer running down their roads.  Conservatives in the US would say... but that would eat into the bottom line.  Whatever you define as free enterprise, because frankly haven't a fucking jack off what you mean and I doubt you do to.  But whatever we have is oligarchy/kleptocracy.  They're not interested anything but short term buck as fast as possible.  And economy of scale from past does require huge government investment before any private operator makes much of any attempt to produce anything, oligarchs that own our grid and power plants want us to give them they're return on investment... so they don't want anymore research until they're 30 year payoff is complete.  I know you're probably trying to speak their language to convince them to stop being stupid... but that's not their language anymore... their definition of free enterprise is greed is good so fuck you I got mine, if the hog shit from my farm kills you, your bad, not mine.  Competitive market principles as a method of discerning what should be collectively owned and operated and or regulated and privately operated. The concept of competitive market principles doesn't exist in the US conservatives' sorry excuses for a brain.   They don't do science, nor logical philosophy like economics.  And please don't use the example of the German Grid and power system. It's among the worse implemented one of them all in Europe. Consumers in Germany pay nearly the highest second only to Denmark of Europe. It's utterly privatized; German oligarchs from Enercon's Aloys Wobben pocketing billions on his windmills in international courts for accusations he stole patents, and the grid providers and plant provides from E.ON, Vattenfall, EnBW, and RWE oligopoly combined yearly fortunes of over hundred billion Euros, and they still use 52% of electricity production from fossil fuels. All you'll do in the US is convince some other US con to con job for a spot on Forbe's billionaire list, and everyone else worse off for the con job; as we'll still 50 years later have the same ratio of what is non-fossil fuel and fossil fuel composing electricity output.  Germany should be commended on their Wendelstein 7x program toward fusion energy.  And commitment to fund R&D to get better results from their renewable methods.  And making grand plans to reduce fossil fuels and bulk up renewables and other non-fossil fuel energy.  But not their business practices in implementation. It's a quagmire scandal that causing the rise of the far extreme authoritarian right wing and the likely ouster of the moderate Merkel in the next few years.... yes, they'll have their backward idiot Trump too soon enough if we continuing on this idiot middle of the road hope some "free enterprise" comes up with all the solutions to the world's problems idiocy, all we need to do is fill the pockets of an oligarchy and they'll shit rainbows and sun shine on all of us idiocy. No. They'll do what all oligarchies do. Create an unstable economy that collapses.  And we'll be worse off.  You're trying to speak a language to through to the dummies that the dummies never spoke in the first place... it was an act... free markets? Competition? HA!

In other words, it's still government control and not only regulated but managed. Economically speaking it's not a Â«conservativeÂ» (non-interventionist) solution.

Do you really think that spending money on the police is "anti-conservative"?  China is hardly a Western conservative's paradise (the absence of democracy and freedom of speech, for one thing!) but his point wasn't that conservatives would like the Chinese economy as a whole.  Also, in the standard use of "capitalism", China is a capitalist economy, but a mixed one. "State capitalist" is a very ambiguous term (often used to excuse the failures of real communist governments in 20th century) though it's weird to use it so that it implies "not capitalist".	0

I don't know what you'r smoking by referring to the 20th cenury because China took it's turn toward SC around 30 years ago and no other Â«communistÂ» country ever had it. (For example Russia went from, starting at the revolution, Leninist communism into Leninist socialism into War Communism Staline's version of Lenin's communism on steroids into Gorbachev's Human Communism into the modern Oligarchic capitalism). Now if people who aren't economist miss use the term that's not my problem.   The point was that he clearly meant a specific type of capitalism or his insistence that the options were denials, conservatism or anti-capitalism made no sense. After all QuÃ©bec's Carbon Trade Market is a capitalist solution and so is the Justin Trudeau's Carbon Taxe but neither are conservative. So since he meant a specific type of capitalism, I doubt that State Capitalism was that given system.  Your counter-example on conservatism and intervention is bad. Government Spending is not interventionism by definition (only libertarian argue that they are). Interventionism and non-interventionism don't distinguish themselves by their spending but by the way they spend/regulate.   Also, if I want to be tongue and cheek, his conservative example, the Iron Lady, DID reduced the budget of the police.  The trichotomy between capitilist, mixed and communist economy is a theoretical and aspirational one. In reality every economy ever is/was mixed. So to claim they aren't State Capitalist because they are a mixed economy is like saying the field of study of economic institutions isn't possible because their all mixed economies.	0

People who aren't familiar with China aren't to know this ofc, and they aren't likely to know how pervasive party control is. Our ignorance about China's system lets us call them socialist when they're doing something we don't like, and capitalist when they're doing something we do like. imo "ä¸­å›½ç‰¹è‰²ç¤¾ä¼šä¸»ä¹‰", socialism with Chinese "characteristics", sums it up.  That having been said I think you've done what many others have done in the comments: latched on to a few of his comments that maybe seen as disparaging collective/government action without looking at his broader point. He said some negative things about environmentalist (maybe to appeal to the intended conservative audience, and maybe not) while praising capitalism. At the same time he clearly says government subsidies play a role in incentivizing innovation, and his favorite example of mankind stepping up the plate--the moon landing--would have been impossible without government.   Just my opinion ofc, but hopefully it gives you another perspective on ph54's comments. Cheers!	0

There's definitely a eugenicist (and even anti-human) strain among some environmentalists. I think that this is one thing that climate change sceptics raise that we really have to watch. Humans can cause great harms to each other and other species, but we're also capable of fantastic things; even our ability to congregate en masse and co-operate rather than kill each other isn't found in other primates, and systematic/produce languages are distinctively human wonders.  One of the great things about incentivising technologies for better energy efficiency and reduced fossile fuel use is that we can have a society that's great for humans today AND tomorrow.	0

While in reality the conservatives are irresponsible and dogmatic in their financial policies. Examples of dogma is their automatic belief that tax cuts for the rich solves everything, privatization is always good and so on, despite facts showing otherwise.

And it isn't really a good example of the private market funding innovation either. Where they not funded by a Kickstarter and by government money?  That being said, you have to be ok with some projects funded not working out in the end. I might argue they should have realized earlier that this specific idea would never work or that they maybe shouldn't have given them that much money, but in the end projects are in some ways experiments and experiments fail. Maybe if the politicians made it better to invest in these kinds of stuff (just like potholer argued in the video) the private sector could take on the risk of these kinds of experiments instead of the public and a whole lot of money from peoples own pocket... The private sector might even have been a bit more sceptical from the start...	1

UgzT0Jt6tOHpfz7o0Xt4AaABAg	OfTinÃºvielsKin	1 day ago	1535955922805	What you speak of as conservatism actually seems more like libralism to me.  Not that conservatism can't be liberal (in their own strange way), but it can also be authoritarian. Core tenents of conservativism like striving to  maintain  strict social roles and cultural and religious homogeneity has often led to opressive laws before and still often do. Take laws against gay marriage or against marijuana use - they are antithetic to liberalism, but very in line with conservativism.   Another thing is that you toss all anti-capitalists into the same "wacky" camp of people "wanting us to go back to living in the stone age", but this is a pretty bawdy strawman. Yes, lefties who idealize the "natural state" and wish to return to it do exist, but there are also conservative communities who do the same - putting moral weight into farming the land and living simply.  There are also many, many anti-capitalists who have nothing against technology, science, innovation or even markets, but simply believe that a capitalist system is not the ideal way to encourage these things. In my experience a lot of modern socialist arguments  use f.ex. automation as an example of a problem socialism would be better able to solve and as a reason why a modern kind of  socialism might work where older kinds failed.  Here's to hoping part 2 will add a bit more nuance.	0	true	7

So socialist complain about wealth inequality. To make something 'equal' first you have to 'compare' the moment you start comparing you already lost the war because then the value system is established. You made judging by wealth okay. This why is "social justice" people are also a product of capitalism's value system, right wingers probably disagree with me on this . What they are complaining about is wealth,education,power,status inequality, you wouldn't complain about these if you thought judging by these superficial attributes isn't okay . Clearly this solidifies the idea it is okay to measure peoples worth by these attributes.  You are not opposing hierarchies you are indulging them .	0

To make the discussion of inequality taboo is to hamper our ability to try to change it.	0
								UgzT0Jt6tOHpfz7o0Xt4AaABAg.8ki7o1278ve8kjwZ3FbfXC	JTA Tll	12 hours ago	1535999123705	I didn't really propose a ideal. I was explaining why socialism is a bi-product of the same world view as the capitalism. I consider comparing itself as immoral . (immoral mean things that lead to your suffering)   There are beggars in this world who are happier than billionaires . I am pretty sure I would be considered "underprivileged" been brown in a "3rd world" country. I do not consider myself underprivileged, actually I consider you less privileged than me because of the way you look at the world. Access to money or education(which is just status at this point) isn't really important to me.  For example lets say I have restaurant I made it vegetarian because I thinking killing animals for pleasure is wrong, it might be less profitable but I am doing it for value I hold higher than the money . So because of this not just me and my entire community might be less rich thus "underprivileged" , this kind of thinking doesn't help... you are just pushing your value system on to me and the people you consider "underprivileged".   Problem with capitalism is psychological. Because in a capitalistic society if I want to get rich I just need to get people addicted to something they don't necessarily need using peoples need for instant gratification it creates lot of habits that are really damaging to the people and society in long term.  People you consider privileged are not privileged they just have more wealth .  Another way of putting this , inequalities you are talking about are not real, they are affected because they subscribe to those values/hierarchies.    I do not mean people who doesn't have a home, I can understand the need to address people's essential needs to survive that is important but that is not what people talk about when they are talking about inequality.  Food,water, clothing and shelter these are all the needs everything else is excess.	0
								UgzT0Jt6tOHpfz7o0Xt4AaABAg.8ki7o1278ve8kkHuShMXZR	OfTinÃºvielsKin	9 hours ago	1536009923715	The socialist worldview (as far as one can generalize about socialism) idealises fairness - they have a problem with capitalism because of the fact that people aren't paid the value of their work and that children's opportunities will be dependant on their parents' lineage and financial success (poverty perpetuates poverty and affluence perpetuates affluence). It is about wanting to give every human an equal opportunity to suceed at whatever it is they want to do regardless of their birth circumstances.  This is an ideal a purely capitalist worldview lacks entirely - it simply doesn't take into account the fact that wealth has a tendency to accumulate in a small population and that this is unfair and unhealthy.   You seem unable to see the fact that having or not having money in a world driven on money will have a huge impact on whether or not you are able to self-actualise (and reach what you have redefined privelige as). I'm happy you've personally found contentment, but I feel you are tossing poor people under the bus by implying that so long as they have a roof over their head and food enough to survive they should just settle down and be content with the world despite the fact that there are people  who were born multi-millionaires in the same country where they have to work long hours at unfulfilling, stressful, low pay jobs to make ends meet.	0

What you are arguing for is basically a theocracy.  There isn't a "value of their work", it is assigned by the society. There is not objective worth of the work.   About children, there are obvious genetic differences how do you equalize those?  And what if my "whatever it is they want to do" is giving my children a good life , and I worked extra hard to give my children a better life you are taking that choice away . "whatever it is they want to do" is actually really anti-intellectual idea that comes from the idea people are unique and unintelligible(basically the concept of soul). This isn't true what people want to do is deducible.   The wealth isn't the only thing that has a tendency to accumulate in small amount of population every other attribute like charisma,innovation,success in artistic side,popularity with opposite gender etc. If you equalize the wealth attribute every other attribute will have higher value and create the same power imbalance. Are you gonna equalize those too? Doesn't this end with every person having to do the same thing?   Privilege is special benefit enjoyed by a person or group of people.  What is benefit?  Something that is advantageous.  Advantageous towards what?  To (in general sense) happiness.  What you are calling privilege doesn't make people happy thus I don't consider it a privilege, I didn't redefine it I simply used the base idea of it .   I'll use wiki definition  "Self-actualization is a term that has been used in various psychology theories, often in slightly different ways. The term was originally introduced by the organismic theorist Kurt Goldstein for the motive to realize one's full potential."  What is logic behind this? Each individual person has unique potential and realizing it will make them happy? Why should people pursue "full potential" ? Does everyone have equal potential? How is this anything other than a personal belief of yours?  I am not throwing people under the bus . I am saying you wouldn't be any happier if you were a millionaire. In short term you might be but after it is normalized you will want even more and be complaining about billionaires and how they are having all that money without working as much as me the millionaires.    World is not driven by money it is driven by greed a human attribute. Even the people who are super rich are also slaves to their greed .  Money is simply the method of exchanging goods .	0

Ugw3eDBQYNNWT9feZxl4AaABAg	Jarod Strain	1 day ago	1535955922912	I truly enjoy your matter-of-fact approach to things.  Indeed in the US most people ignore the fact that our federal government has always subsidized the energy industry.  Coal and oil are heavily subsidized today as they always have been. Most power plants in the u.s. are built with more tax dollars than they are private funds. But people who would have been against the development of renewable energy have ignored this point and suggested that the same subsidies would give an unfair advantage to Renewables. The solutions proposed by the mainstream have been being proposed as I'm sure you're aware since the 1970s. And it did been taken up at that time it would have been a slow gradual change that would be fully implemented by this time. So what we're left with is proposals sound more and more extreme because they've been rejected for 50 years and we still have the same problem. So now we have to play catch-up. The American right beginning under Nixon and gradually culminating with mr. Trump has developed a more and more divisionist perspective. It is no longer about conservative at ideology, but simply a movement about opposing the other side at all cost. If the American left agrees to conservative proposals, conservatives will drop those proposals and reach for something more extreme. It has been driven from the top down in a manner where our leaders have begun to call their political adversaries enemies instead of colleagues. Make no mistake you see some of this on the left, but to such a lesser degree that you really have to search for it. Then we have the left-wing extreme which is constantly opposed to anything capitalist, and most Americans find irritatingly irrational. This extreme is almost without representation at the government level. The closest would probably be Bernie Sanders, who still favors a free market. For myself I'm a very conservative person, but rationality dictates that we have to recognize liberalism contributes a great deal to society. You don't see a lot of innovation from conservative people. One thing that does concern me in society is a lack of understanding of economics. Free markets and capitalism are neither the same thing nor do they necessarily go together. Capitalism dictates that you knew anything possible to maximize profits. The best maximization of profits is usually achieved through Monopoly, which certainly doesn't go with a free market.	0	false	0

The talking point of no regulations is what leads to pollutants that need to be fixed. It was cheaper to dump the nuclear waste in the local river, but now the free market has come up with a profitable way to fix that. Whereas if you prevent the dumping in the first place with regulation you never have to find the solution. Many free markets are by nature reactive, not to say governments and socialist regimes aren't, but prevention is better than cure.	0	false	0

The capacity factor of a nuclear plant is over 90% while solar is pitiful 10-20% and grid scale storage is orders of magnitude below what we need. I think our regulations need to be relaxed when it comes to molten salt reactors because they simply don't go up in steam like Chernobyl or hydrogen like Fukushima.

Ugzx-wc_gkVsMt1RfzR4AaABAg	vi	1 day ago	1535955924771	I'm one of the "fringe" weirdos who doesn't like capitalism, but I appreciate your attempts to talk sense into conservative-minded people, even if I think it's ultimately futile.  That being said, I have some pretty major disagreements with this video. For example, you cite the American transcontinental railroads as an example of American go-getter attitudes, but the American entrepreneurs weren't the ones "rolling up their sleeves" and solving problems in that case; Chinese immigrants were the ones making it a reality, and they barely got to see any of the benefits, and many of them died in the process. We "fringe" anti-capitalists see similar exploitation behind the scenes of most, if not all, "entrepreneurial achievements," which is why I would prefer solutions that don't revolve around such exploitation. The capitalist class may have good ideas, but ultimately it's the rest of us who are actually putting them into practice, often without much material reward, which leads me to believe that we can bypass this class entirely and solve problems ourselves.  Anti-capitalism isn't about "going back," to some kind of barbarism, it's about examining how labor is exploited in the present, how capital contributes to power dynamics in our society, and what can be done about it. It's a little disingenuous to paint anti-capitalist criticism, a tradition about as old as capitalism itself with dozens of competing philosophies, as just some backwards weirdos who want us to go back to living in caves.  Anyway, I hope that provides a little food for thought. I love your videos and respect your mission to protect science from misrepresentations of all sorts, but when it comes to politics, I just couldn't disagree more. C'est la vie.	11	false	0

UgxNTgpS_5yUegBRMr54AaABAg	GrasponReality	1 day ago	1535955924840	There are a couple of other important points. People love to point to the intermittency of renewables but ignore the fact that no power plant has 100% up time and fossil fuel plants fail regularly  often without  warning and when they do they can fail catastrophically and since most power plants are large an unplanned failure can cause huge problems for the grid.  In actual fact using weather forecasting tools renewable production can be accurately predicted at least 5 days into the future.  The other point I'd make is on the conservation side where industry often lobbies hard against any sort of regulation, the problem is that often this results in much higher energy use for the consumer. Often the consumer doesn't take into consideration energy costs in a product but in the US just requiring new appliances to show how much energy they use led to a shift in products but without the requirement to show energy use people are left in the dark.  A good example is the home building industry where they will often lobby against more stringent building codes. This might save the builder $2000 in construction costs but could easily result in the consumer paying $100 or more per month additional for energy which is essentially a tax on the building for the entire life of the building...

UgxzmfG908mJbQ0KG7h4AaABAg	hyotis	1 day ago	1535955924913	Interesting video. But you make some contradictory remarks. On one hand you applaud free market Capitalism as the road to success in solving the climate change problem (and I agree) yet you are for government subsidies to wind and solar.  This I don't agree with. Wind is basically 100% subsidized by the US government and solar about 50-75%. If the free market is to 'work it's magic' we  must eliminate these subsidies and let entrepreneurs solve the problems with these renewables (as you suggest). If they can't stand up in the free market (especially at this point, as your video suggests) then that just means the tech isn't there yet. But that doesn't mean it won't get there in the future. The actual free market approach is to identify a problem (climate change) then let genius entrepreneurs think of a solution. It is NOT to use government to accomplish this goal. This is because once government gets involved incentives become distorted. I will wager that, if left alone, free of subsidies, wind and solar will make greater headway. Or maybe something else will get discovered. Who really knows? But one thing is for sure. The free market will provide...  And what about nuclear? When it comes to reducing CO2 in the atmosphere, nobody ever mentions this energy source that is cheap, clean, efficient and effective.	0	false	0

Or how was the sauropods able to support their huge bodies with such long necks and more baffling teeny pin heads. If an elephant has to eat all day to support it's body, how the hell could 180 ton creatures with 50 ft necks sustain such a large mass? The giraffe is an amazing example of specialized design. Any ideas?     If that little head could sustain it's needed nutrients, surely the world was much more nutrient rich per gram of plant matter etc. But even the ability for the cardiovascular system to get oxygen to the deepest tissues seems impossible. Even if you up the atmospheric pressure x3 and increase oxygen percentage in the atmosphere to 30% it can't explain how those animals could support the neck.	0	true	6

Large heads are only needed for large jaw muscles or as a weapon. Also, dinosaurs had a very different type of respiratory system than we mammals have, just look at birds, living dinosaurs.

He shows many species are really just younger and older stages of a species. With very quick bone growth which concentrated growth in plates and spikes on their body. Losing it it one place and migrating it to another. Making them look quite different as they aged. "Dr.Horner the ever morphing dinosaurs". This just shows to me the many false assumptions of the common descent idea in the general theory of evolution(common ancestry). What was assumed to be a vast variation developed over vast time lines causing relational evolution of species was really different stages in the single life of a specific animal.       The same mistake one would imagine would be postulated if the contemporary different sub species of dogs were be buried today, with their vast differences, would lead to possible false time lines of vast periods to explain their development.  When much shorter time is possible.      It doesn't prove special creation I just supports the notion that certain assertions and past explanations could be false pertaining to the biota.	0

Out of the great apes, humans have the smallest skulls even with our giant brains. Why is that? We donâ€™t have the massive jaw muscles the great apes have. The giant herbivorous dinosaurs didnâ€™t really chew their food, so they didnâ€™t have large jaw muscles. All they need their heads to was have a big enough hole to stuff food down. Furthermore, secondary sex characteristics with rapid growth during are not an argument against Darwinan evolution.	0

Nuclear efficiency is tiny with around 0.3% I've just read. (Which is so low that I don't trust the number), but I know it is below 40%.  "Most efficient" That is a common talking point but it is misleading and plain wrong or better it is using the wrong therm.  A nuclear power plant is like some heat solar, coal, etc. power plants creating heat and turning it into electricity via steam. It has an efficiency limit of around 60%. (Canon cycle) and a real efficiency of 30-40%.  Hydro has an efficiency of over 85% which is much higher.  You might not mean efficiency, but the ratio of peak power to average power (as that is the common talking point), which is very high with nuclear, but that is due to them being base load power plants.  In any way, both are things that sound important, but are more or less irrelevant.  Tbc	0

(Answer: 1,356 wind turbines, 300 solar farms @ 25 acres per farm, not to mention sun/wind every day.)  Today's nuclear plants (e.g. TerraPower) can run on depleted uranium, of which we have so much stored that we could meet the US' power needs for 750 years.  There is also virtually zero chance of meltdown or disaster; all previous disasters occurred with outdated water-cooled reactors and poor design, while today's engineers have figured out clever solutions to the problems that caused previous disasters. And again, nuclear power does not emit carbon into the atmosphere, so it's much cleaner than coal or natural gas.  Check out "NOVA: The Nuclear Option" on Netflix.	0

If we currently have a warmer climate nowadays, then why are things better for everyone around the world?

								UgwAXzEv7cyKfJBK5tB4AaABAg.8ki1ri-ESNT8kiBP6NmJaX	Jakob Schulze	1 day ago	1535955927493	"Harsher winter" There are places in the Middle East having over 50 C on a regular basis.

We've been living with higher CO2 already for 100 years now and life has never been better on the planet. So I think the reason you choose 100 years rather than 5 years is because there is no way to verify your statement and it just has to be taken on faith. It's not like you can be held accountable for your error in 100 years, because you'll be dead by that time. This is also why many people always claim that this year is the final year to act, because if someone was to say "lets wait 100 years to see what happens", then it destroys your whole argument.  As for the desert being really hot in the summer, there are many factors at play. Larger cities with a heat island effect can cause higher summer temperatures as well.	0

Like I've said there is damage today, but even if we do changes today, we still will see dsbahe in 100 years of the things we did in the past.  As an analogy. If you have smoked for 40 years and stop smoking now, you will see some benefits now, but the biggest benefits you will see in 20 years. You still will see the damage of 40 years of smoking, but the damage would have been much bigger if you would have continued for an other 20 years.	0

You can't simply say that there is damage, you have to show proof of it.   Hot weather in Saudi Arabia isn't proof, because there are lots of other factors involved in weather (not climate, but weather, they are different). For the same reason, if I pointed to a really cold winter, that would not be proof that the climate is cooling.  I think the issue here is that people are afraid of change. Sometimes change can be good though. A warmer climate is better for humans. Studies have proven that society is better as the climate warms.	0

You know like talking about nuclear powered cars in the 50s. Totally crazy but it created excitement and made it more likely that overall research got financed, etc.  If the alternative is, that the topic is ignored altogether, than there is some good in it some could argue.  Still it would be preferable if it wasn't something that silly that created the excitement.	0
								UgxjUfALCItF54RY2U54AaABAg.8ki05EaB7qx8kk0Nmk4wis	Pebkio Nomare	12 hours ago	1535999131698	Except that nuclear power didn't really get the research it needed.  And science doesn't stop working when we want the public to get excited.  We're only setting ourselves up for inevitable failure by ignoring reality.  What do you think happens when you get someone excited for something that you should know isn't actually going to work?  And we knew it wasn't going to work because physics doesn't change to accommodate hopes and dreams.  So they started installing solar roadways and the obvious happened.  The obvious keeps happening.  Now there are negative experiences (plural) centered around funding clean energy.  Ambivalent feelings are better than negative feelings.  And yes, I get that things go wrong sometimes, but solar roadways required a supernatural miracle to go right.  There wasn't just the potential for things to go wrong... it was an undeniable certainty.	1
								UgxjUfALCItF54RY2U54AaABAg.8ki05EaB7qx8kk7uOFgxHH	Jakob Schulze	11 hours ago	1536002731710	Pebkio Nomare Just to be clear, I'm/was just playing devils advocate there.  "Except that nuclear power didn't really get the research it needed." What do you mean by that? Without government funding we wouldn't have one nuclear power plant. The public has invested a ton in nuclear research in part due to public support. Once it was clear, that the nuclear promises couldn't be fullfilled and that after a couple of accidents, the public opinion shifted.  "What do you think happens when you get someone excited for something that you should know isn't actually going to work?" Some people get actually rich of things like that. Look at all those TV christians. Also as an example. If I want to develop A, but A doesn't sound sexy, but there is an idea that A could be used in B  (even everyone knows that it can't work), but B is sexy. Then advertising with B and creating support, could help you to get the funding to develop A.  Just to be clear again. I don't favor this. It is like homeopathy. It is BS, but we live in an attention economy. Sometimes people prefer BS over reality.	0
								UgxjUfALCItF54RY2U54AaABAg.8ki05EaB7qx8kkADLp05zT	Pebkio Nomare	10 hours ago	1536006331721	Thanks for clearing that up about the roadways.  Normally that is a completely honest response to people who point out that it could never have worked.  As for the nuclear.  yeah, we funded it enough to develop the first major type of nuclear reactor (Light Water Reactors), then build that reactor over and over, and then get all anti-nuclear when that first type of reactor had some issues.  That "all important" hype died in the late 70s and the commercial push to switch to nuclear died shortly after in the mid 80s.  While nuclear research still gets some funding, it's not near enough to actually produce anything.  Scientists have come up with models, but without the massive funding, they don't have what it takes to make those models a reality.  So far 90% of all reactors use the reaction to heat water.  80% of all reactors use light water and 10% use heavy water.  Coming up with one innovation and using it ad-nauseam before giving up is not what I'd call "having enough funding".	0

UgxplNjTp_tivoItGHB4AaABAg	Kyle Smyth	1 day ago	1535955930789	It's pretty straightforward here in the US. Supreme court says that donating money to a campaign = speech and that corporations are people that enjoy the right to freedom of speech. To make matters far worse they also effectively got rid of the limits on political donations.  The inevitable result of infinite amounts of $ in political campaigns is that everything skews toward the conclusions that moneyed interests want. Facts are a minor nuisance to be dealt with if and when the need arises via mass disinformation campaigns, corporate-sponsored studies, and paid shills like Ben Shapiro who was featured here.   Global warming, among dozens of other crucial issues will likely never ever be truly addressed in the US until those decisions are undone. I suppose if renewable energy becomes a more efficient way to extract wealth from the general population that also might prompt a paradigm shift... Until then, it's up to the rest of the world to lead the way on this. The political system in the US is too dysfunctional to help.	0	false	0

We would be independent. There is literally no downside. Unless of course, you are part of the entrenched fossil fuel industry.

"Don't worry, fellas, we won't let this green energy thing get too far off the ground. And thanks for the cash." It was so obvious that even the pundits of the time didn't try to spin it (though there were far fewer of them than there are now).

The issue is that there is the freedom to do something, which they favor, and the freedom of something not done to you, which is favored, but much lower on the list.  Issue here seems to be, that potholer mixes together libertarians and conservatives as in reality they are mixed aswell and always have.  Conservatives and libertarians both vote R over D.  To take an extreme example look at hitler gaining power (yes I know, but I only take that example as everyone knows it).

He did at least some level of 5 in the "The Concequences of Climate Change (In Our Lifetime)" video.  I'm not sure how much he's willing to go after guys like Molyneux at least in the near future.  Crowder (whose "interviews" with Molyneux were a part of Potholer's videos, IIRC) and SuspiciousObserver probably has him a little gunshy after the intellectually bankrupt runaround they gave him.

Ugynmw6mhKj8HybDD2V4AaABAg	Austin Hurt	1 day ago	1535955932922	Two problems.  First, I think it is a bit dishonest to compare climate deniers and anti-capitalists as equally fringe.  To the best of my knowledge the anti-capitalists are a tiny minority almost everywhere in the world while the climate deniers have enormous political and economic power.  Their position isn't fringe, it is very mainstream, no matter how wrong they are.   Second, there is a matter of semantics.  How do you define capitalism?  Because, especially American conservatives, have a very specific kind of capitalism in mind, namely, their so called free market capitalism.  They view subsidies to benefit a specific industry or taxes to harm a specific industry as intolerable interference in the market.  And in their dichotomous world view, that makes you no better than and actual socialist or communist opposed to capitalism.	0	false	0

Ugw51yKMxo2rydRi-A54AaABAg	Sagan Worshipper	1 day ago	1535955933016	The values of science and the values of democracy are concordant, in many cases indistinguishable. Science and democracy began - in their civilized incarnations - in the same time and place, Greece in the seventh and sixth centuries BC. Science confers power on anyone who takes the trouble to learn it (although too many have been systematically prevented from doing so). Science thrives on, indeed requires, the free exchange of ideas; its values are antithetical to secrecy. Science holds to no special vantage points or privileged positions. Both science and democracy encourage unconventional opinions and vigorous debate. Both demand adequate reason, coherent argument, rigorous standards of evidence and honesty. Science is a way to call the bluff of those who only pretend to knowledge. It is a bulwark against mysticism, against superstition, against religion misapplied to where it has no business being. If we're true to its values, it can tell us when we're being lied to. It provides a mid-course correction to our mistakes. The more widespread its language, rules and methods, the better chance we have of preserving what Thomas Jefferson and his colleagues had in mind. But democracy can also be subverted more thoroughly through the products of science than any pre-industrial demagogue ever dreamed.	0	false	0

The US left/right split stopped being a political disagreement, and started becoming a full time tribal war thanks to Fox News (Murdoch should be hanged for war incitement as far as I am concerned).  The US right does not care about facts, they only care about making the left wing suffer as much as possible.  They are now nothing more than a cult of terrorists.  I'm not being hyperbolic here.  I have seen otherwise rational, educated friends and family, go completely irrational, unable to accept the most basic reality (think Rudy Giuliani's recent "true is not true" statement).    How can you even discuss anything with people that will say 2+2=4 is fake news?  This goes way beyond climate change.  People worry about Kim Fatty the 3rd having a nuke?  That's nothing compared to the much more unstable Siberian Candidate having thousands of them.  Currently the only thing stopping him are those few rational and responsible right wingers in his government and the military.  Should they be prevented from running interference, the whole world will be screwed long before climate change has a chance to get us.  * This is not to say the left wing has totally clean hands, it doesn't.

We will all die at 2008 from oil running out. That's the problem, you had a profiteur, and many like him, using global warming as a political pony for attention and financial gain. Combine this with globalism and you have jobs leaving the poor areas of the Midwest in favour of Chinese slave labour in battery and solar panel factories. Yes the industry around renewable is huge... but it offers no financial means of sustaining the working class in the West because all jobs are outsourced. If the US put all subsidies that go to oil right now into solar power all you'd get is the retail end of the solar power in the US and the manufacturing shipped off, again, to China and other countries where openly dumping chemicals in the river isn't such a big deal.  Renewables are great. They could generate enough power to last the whole world and battery farms are ever more becoming a feasible reality. This does nothing to change the fact that price of power went up as it always does by 30% over 10 years thanks to the renewable surcharge in Germany, meanwhile the Netherlands has lowered the price by 13% whilst remaining more fossil fuel heavy than Germany, that no jobs for the working class are created because outsourcing is cheaper and that you will have to contend.  In a vacuum nation where no jobs can leave. The government doesn't impose a surcharge for the use of clean energy. No other nations can draw or sell power. Renewables are the solution. In reality phasing out coal and all other forms of fossil fuel will make you dependant on Chinese manufacturing for supply of cheap products whilst raising the cost of power through government intervention.

UgxOQ8RCal8pAjRuXZt4AaABAg	JDela10	1 day ago	1535955935965	Potholer, Big fan, have been for many years. In fact, when I first watched your videos on the history of science, evolution and so on, I was far more "left-leaning" than I am now. As I got older I felt that experience has shifted me more to right-of-center. However, that hasn't affected how I see science at all. I think the evidence for warming and humanity's part in it is undeniable at this point. A lot of people either center or to the right accept the science but have misgivings about how climate change is used in public discourse and political debate. These days, the word "denier" has been not only against people who genuinely deny the science (usually because they are ill-informed about it) but also against people who challenge anything at all related to it. Let me give you an example.  In "An Inconvenient Sequel" there is a scene where we are shown a flooded street in Miami Beach. Gore is trying in the scene to link it to melting ice and rising sea levels. The docu even shows a person saying they lived there for a long time and this flooding never happened. So the message is this is a new consequence of global warming melting ice that is happening in Miami Beach. However, Shimon Wdowinski, associate professor of marine geology and geophysics at the Florida International University, has studied the issue of street flooding in Miami. While Wdowinski doesn't rule out rising sea levels as a factor (U.S. eastern seaboard has seen rising of 6mm - 9mm per year due to changes in ocean currents.. while long-term sea level rise from thermal expansion and melting ice is 2mm), he also notes something very important. Satellite data shows that many Miami streets are now 16cm - 24cm lower than they were 80 years ago. They are sinking, as is much of the state of Florida, and that could be a significant reason why flooding now affects streets it didn't a long time ago.   Ross Clark asked Al Gore about the issue. As soon as he mentioned Wdowinski's name, Gore interrupted him and said something like "I don't know him, is he a denier?". Clarke continued to make the point to which Gore interrupted again and asked, "Are you a denier?". Clarke gave an honest answer that he is sure that climate change is a problem but not sure how big of a problem is actually is, to which Gore asserted, "You are a denier!". The Q&A was then ended and Clarke was approached by a member of his PR team later saying that the event was only to promote the film and not for scientific questions. However, the question was relevant to a particular scene in the film.  So that's an example of what you have to put up with if you express skepticism (in this case, genuine skepticism!) at a claim made in favor of climate change. You get branded as a denier, and these days climate change "denial" is sort of like blasphemy used to be. Want to hurt somebody's reputation? Call that person a climate denier! So if somebody accepts that the Earth is warming, accepts the isotopic evidence suggests human activity is responsible for the increased CO2, but are skeptical about the apocalyptic scenarios that are foretold.. that person is now a denier? That seems unreasonable to me and I often defend people who are treated as if they committed a thought crime for expressing skepticism. I also like to remind people that the vast majority of scientists accepting global warming is man-made and a problem doesn't mean they all agree on the consequences or the timeframe for those consequences.  In your video, you also talk about problems and solutions. However, when we're talking about public policies we are typically talking about tradeoffs rather than mere solutions. Market regulations do really restrict consumer choice, for example, and can even affect the cost of living which is no small factor in prosperity. You oppose those kinds of regulations it is very hard to win when the other side doesn't just claim to be saving the world, but actually believes it is saving the world. It is also an area open to abuse. Before the Brexit referendum in the UK, for example, a set of proposed Single Market regulations would have set some energy standards on items like hair dryers etc. These regulations were pushed as environmental, but it turned out they would really have a negligible effect on actual energy consumption, and when you looked deeper you saw that European manufacturers were pushing the regulations as a means to ban imports of rival's producs to the Single Market. I don't know what happened to those but they were shelved until after the Brexit referendum because some on the pro-Brexit side listed them as examples of regulatory fuckery by the EU.  Overall though, you are right that the biggest gripe the right and conservatives have with climate change is not the Science, but what they perceive as the political football game used over the issue. I mean look at the response to Trump pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement. Pure hysteria about how America is not a leader and blah blah blah. In reality, even the UN Environmental Programme projects the world is on track for a 3C increase in temperature even with 100% compliance, which of course was never going to happen. So when the UN itself says it won't manage its goal at keeping temperature increase to 2C or less, and when the agreement was not passed through the U.S. Senate for approval as any treaty should be (as it did mandate the transfer of billions from the United States overseas) then what is the problem with Trump calling it a bad agreement and pulling out? Oh, ye, he's a Republican, and he's Trump, so that's why! It doesn't matter that it won't work anyway and was passed by unconstitutional means. That is the power of climate change in political debate.	0	true	2

I made exactly the same point when I saw an Al-Jazeera news package about islands off the coast of Panama flooding "because of global warming," based on a Reuters report. I did some research and discovered that in fact the sea level "rise" was due to tectonic subsidence -- the islands were sinking.     Sea level rise due to global warming is real, but ignoring inconvenient facts about land movement in order to exaggerate only serves to undermine the science and make people suspicious.	0
								UgxOQ8RCal8pAjRuXZt4AaABAg.8khuk3FFuSH8kjkyzVpPmr	JDela10	14 hours ago	1535991936520	Thanks for the reply mate. Ye, my reply was really just a quickly mashed up response from someone who kind of sees it from the other side, even though I accept the science behind it. I agree that what Gore did is harmful to the cause too and I typed it up as an example of what it was like for this person to simply question one claim in his movie. He was immediately branded, in front of a crowd. Gore's response to him was his way of telling him "shut the fuck up" and signalling to others not to listen to him. That's a problem.  I think a lot of people also have climate change fatigue at this point. Any unusual weather is climate change these days. In Ireland, we had a couple of fairly rare events in the past year. We were hit by a storm that originated as a hurricane half a world away and we also had a fairly bad blizzard. Just as you can predict the sun rise tomorrow morning, the media then lectured Ireland on climate change, that these two extremely rare events (but tend to happen every few decades or so) are actually evidence of climate change and that we have to get used to it and prepare for it to be the norm etc. That seems a little alarmist to me and I'm not alone. I think a lot of people roll their eyes when they hear "climate change" now.  What the public hears about climate change is almost completely through the lens of political debate.. or political smearing. I genuinely believe that both the deniers in politics, and those who accept climate change, have one thing in common: they likely both don't really understand it themselves. That's why unfortunately we get these cases where some politician talking climate change can't answer a few basic questions and then that interview or video gets passed around and used as "evidence" that it's bullshit. It makes you wonder if people like Al Gore haven't just made things far worse when it comes to public acceptance of science by politicizing it? That's why your channel is a breath of fresh air, because you take on the errors and inaccuracies directly and respond to them. You explain things like carbon flux to people who would have zero reason to understand it at all. You turn people from being skeptical on the science to accepting it. One YouTuber, Independent Man (aussie youtuber who made videos from a centist, right-leaning point of view) made a video a while back where he came out as a "lukewarmer" (his words lol). He referenced your channel and explained essentially that having watched your videos he became convinced of the science, but he describes himself as a lukewarmer since he still has plenty of skepticism about how climate change is used and perhaps about some of the more apocalyptic claims etc. So you should keep doing what you are doing.  Anyway, sorry for the second long-ass reply!	0

I mean, even if a world where capitalism was green, it is still capitalism. And all the people with the money and power and resources will use them to keep and expand their own wallets and power. We'd still have billions of people on earth, poorer and a few hundred. I'm not advocating the downfall of capitalism, nor do I think we'll move to enough green energy to make a real difference. I just don't think there is any real chance of avoiding a global catastrophe :(	9	true	7

Capitalism requires consumption, consumers need income, producers need consumers. Concentration of wealth is inefficient and distorts markets to the point where they eventually break down. Currently we're dangerously close to a collapse of the capitalist system as the income of consumers is falling along with the supply of cheap raw materials. Either the 0.1% will release some of their wealth back into the system or they will use it to try and shield themselves from the coming catastrophe. In the past the latter strategy has always failed although it's never been tried on a global scale.	0

We've seen in India, China, and Botswana that there is nothing inevitable about the grotesque poverty that has existed throughout the entire history of the Third World.  People used to talk about the "Chinese collectivist mentality" or the "Hindu growth rate" or "black African IQ" holding back these countries into permanent poverty. But there is nothing "inferior" about these peoples or cultures! Under capitalist with good governance, there can be prosperity for a black or white man, a man or woman, a Hindu or a Christian, a Chinese or an American. That's the history of the past 40 years.	0

UgznoEuVA5xX3LWr3VZ4AaABAg	Dennis Renner	1 day ago	1535955936116	Capitalism requires growth.  Perpetual exponential growth.  Population growth, energy growth, and resource growth all equal capitalistic economic growth whether it is considered clean, green, renewable, or carbon based.  If growth stops, our current system of capitalism crashes.   The laws of physics show us that perpetual exponential grow is impossible.  Nothing of course is perpetual.    The predicament.  Second flaw,  Science now has found over 60 positive feed back loops that are contributing, and possibly are driving abrupt climate change.  Then there is the issue of global dimming.  All the sulfates, and pollution we are putting into the atmosphere is helping to keep the planet cool, or at least is slowing down the heating.  If we were to suddenly stop putting these sulfates into the atmosphere the planet would heat up with in 6 weeks to a level that would destroy our habitat according to science.  We are in the sixth mass extinction, and climate change is a major driver.    I don't see the political will, or economic incentive for humanity to sequester the carbon from the oceans, and atmosphere to pre-industrial levels.  Even if it were possible to do.  So far geo engineering at the scale needed is still fantasy technology.   Then there is the fact that the capitalist system has every country in debt.  http://www.usdebtclock.org/   Just add up the red ink. Debt exceeds global derivatives.  our system of capitalism is base on dogmas, myths, and superstitions.  If we replaced capitalism with an economic system base on the laws of physics, in a resource based economy that included all environmental variables.

UgygEY7Okp97gC2Of5l4AaABAg	8DX	1 day ago	1535955936140	The complaints re:capitalism in this context are not about markets not being effective at driving innovation, but that profit-driven labour exploitation leads to mass hoarding of wealth by a relatively small number of people who are then further incentivised to work in their own personal short-term interest rather than the interest of the population in general and whose wealth provides the resources, media control and political clout to ensure your proposed capitalist solution (effectively cutting profits and devaluing sunk costs by subsidisation of innovation/taxation of pollution) doesn't leave the ground, progress is delayed, people are misinformed and vote against their interests. Which is why the actual argument is that the situation in the US is a direct result of capitalism and the greed of those in charge.  It's a sad day when Thatcher's positions (as on the EU) are to the left of the current "conservative" right. Anyway, great video and you're obviously right: government regulation of CO2 emissions would naturally lead to reductions in emissions and hasten the transition to a fully renewable energy economy without having to have a global revolution.

Solar thermal is a very good idea in the right location for grid level generation.  We have huge amounts of deserts in the American South West which could be used for solar thermal electric generation and then sold to the large metro areas near them.

Solar roadways have the additional problems of using led lights in their design. Still the fundamental problem is not hard to understand. Putting the panel over the road or by the roadside allows you to angle the pannel into the sun. It also means you don't have to deal with as much dirt or wear and tear on it.

Things were moving in that direction for a long time with beepers and car phones. Heck I remember having phones with super long coords that spooled up like a tape measure in my home, and then later cordless phones. (these phones had a charger based that plugged into the phone jack and were wireless. People used hand held two way radios to coordinate my summer camp trips. I don't think the appeal of flight was ever under dispute though the engineering ability was did not exist for a long time.  In contrast the appeal of solar roadways and similar is merely let's put this everywhere! Unless we are running out of places where we can ANGLE the panels for efficiency gain, this is just a poor use of the panel. This makes exactly as much sense as putting a wind farm behind a wall blocking the wind instead of in front of it or on top of it. even if you could somehow redirect the wind around the wall it would be cheaper to place the windmill in front of the wall, and you would get better results if you used the wind redirecting technology in a place with more wind(like in front of the wall).  Hell why don't we just use a bunch of mirrors to redirect the sunlight and place the solar panels underground, lots of room there, we wouldn't even have to invent any new technology.	1

Conservatives if you have known anything from history tend to be traditionalist which never tend to last long. Here is something scary and surprising,  The average age of the world's great civilizations has been only about 200 years. "A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largess from the public treasury. From that time on the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury, with the results that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship." - Sir Alex Fraser Tytler United States is a republic but elects congress based on a democracy. Here is the issue the President is elected based on a republic system. The founding fathers knew that a democracy could lead to a dictatorship which is why they  made it both, but the problem comes afterward as the founding fathers did not in anyway think it fully through or would have imagined America to be what it is today. America is divided between two parties which tend to be picked or controlled by the people but yet those policies and ideas are their own this leads to even more problems since if a single person holds the most power in his/her party then the rest will follow this leads to a flawed system as the founding fathers wanted to get away from a tyrant but instead made it possible for multiple tyrants to come about each with their own ideas and policies. If the fathers knew what has become of the system today then I can assure you that conservatives and liberals would not be a thing since one is so far right while the other is so far left which in return makes it almost impossible for another party to agree or express their ideas which could aside with either left or right.	4

Conservatives lack moral values in life...period.  They care less about people around them, they just care about themselves and right now...because they're hoping their invisible being will take care of anything else!  What's funny is....your zombie is nothing like you and your guns...yet here you are defending your rights for guns.  And US conservatives also can't stand helping people that they don't know.    The problem with American capitalism is....too many conservatives are involved in it and they'd sell their mother to make a buck.  They don't care about anything 100 years from now...it's one of the reasons why our streams and waterways are trashed.  Potholer might think capitalism works and he may have a point outside of the USA but he clearly doesn't know the mind set of the USA capitalism.  Left unchecked the US would be a landfill in no time.   Looking back at the 60's and 70's where our waterways reached the point that if you caught anything out of them and ate it, you'd have a good chance of becoming sick from it.  Mercury, lead, PCP, CCA and the list goes on and on....   We currently have free market conservatives fighting to allow coal ash to be dumped into our waterways claiming that it will be alright as long as it's released slowly into the system!!   Spend a few years in the US and learn about capitalism here....money is the only thing it cares about....it doesn't give a shit about what the environment is like in 50 years.   I wouldn't have an issue with capitalism if it had a moral foundation, but it doesn't.	13

Ugy41FPsE7E2ggc412R4AaABAg	Matthew Dylla	1 day ago	1535955942470	No offense but it seems a little one sided here, I understand that you are disappointed with America's stance but like you said about the rail system we're not just shoving our thumb up our ass. For example your battery in Australia was designed by Elon Musk, for those who don't know he's American. Also how does this reasoning work when you can go back and look at multiple types of alternative energy throughout time in America alone that were left behind for being less efficient.  I don't disagree with your overall point, we need to do something to counteract this. Nor do I disagree with your point that MOST politicians on the left and right especially in America have a one-sided view on the issue. However what I have a problem with is you ignoring specific concerns and details like I mentioned above with Elon Musk an American designing one of those leading edge technologies despite the government not giving him a hand under the table. In China for example is it not true that the state is largely in charge of society to a degree that more than the fear of jail you run the risk of being assaulted or being literally doxed and harassed for going against what the government says? Therefore I think it's a little asinine to sit there and say oh wow they're doing so well when they basically have a slightly more humane thought control program than North Korea. I want to see more developments especially in the field of space and energy sources however I don't abide by any government putting the tax gun to a company's head or telling the people what they need to do rather than what should be done and leaving them to it. Also unless I missed it you never spoke about the large environmental cost to produce batteries for either electric cars/hydrogen cars(actually worse and less efficient) but instead have a throw away line about rolling up one's sleeves and just make a better battery. I think these things will happen but it will take time, and that the effect of any "solution" currently on the table will present as many issues even if they are not of the same kind as more traditional power sources. For instance the mass death of birds due to wind turbines.   https://www.energy.gov/articles/history-electric-car  https://alternativeenergy.procon.org/view.timeline.php?timelineID=000015  https://www.wsj.com/articles/that-calm-chinese-stock-market-its-engineered-by-the-government-1527775089  https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/#3dd4a9387999  https://abcbirds.org/wind-energy-threatens-birds/  https://news.energysage.com/solar-panels-toxic-environment/  I'd also include a paper from the European Commission but I can't find a link to it and it's date from the early 2000s makes me question it's findings but I think I made my point. If you want to see it though search for "Environmental Impacts of Hydrogen-based Energy Systems" paper was published 19 October 2006. Also again I'd like to state I don't want to support idiots on either side stating like you said that it's fake or that we need to go back to donkey carts but I do think that you have this habit of snubbing your nose at a group because they seem like an obvious target but it makes you miss key points.

As I pointed out in the video, some American states are formulating their own carbon-reducing policies in the absence of any Federal policy, so there are lots of private enterprise initiatives going on. Tesla is just one of them. But Musk chose to build the largest battery in the world in Australia, not America, and that's the point. The South Australian government supports this kind of initiative and has ambitious goals to reduce CO2 output -- the USA does not.	0

It was as much a publicity for clean energy's future as it was a way to solve a well known problem. Where as America uses fossil to augment green energy in a way that usually doesn't lead to power outages outside of maintenance or damage to systems Australia had suffered a large power outage due to a lapse in supply vs demand so this allowed him to prove the technology as well as help people in need. I would like to think he would have built it anywhere that the same premise was met. I would also like to think that because of government interference in the green energy field in America Trump wouldn't be receptive to supporting such a project because so far he's trying to be hands off regulations and government supports and only interfering with government markets where a loss as has been large on record for longer periods of times. Can't say I support him wholly but it's easier to justify than playing favorites like with the big company bailouts here during the last recession.	0

UgxO_9ZxeNFqaitcwGB4AaABAg	EdwardHowton	1 day ago	1535955942495	A noble and valiant effort, but sadly I think it'll be akin to Don Quixote tilting at windmills. Conservatives can never accept that reality doesn't match their views. If they ever did so, they'd cease to be so freaking conservative and get a goddamn clue. "You people who understand basic facts of reality don't understand economics" says it all. They think economics are a magical system that bears its own special rules, which can be altered by the proper rituals. It's no wonder conservatism and God go hand in hand so much, why there's so many "prosperity gospel" scumbags bilking people of their last dollar and promising three thousand percent returns. Climate change and the facts can't be correct because it would be inconvenient to their wallets.  I wish they could be reached with sense, but they'll deny global warming until their summer homes are underwater, and then they'll just blame the gays again. I mean, anyone with sense understands that a sustainable economy is a good thing, but the ideal form of conservatism is rapid, short-term burnt-ground profits. It's how the Romneys got rich, serially murdering businesses and killing jobs in order to profit from what basically amounts to salvage. They'd torch the planet to ash if they could figure out how to make it profitable... but instead they're happy with the current slow burn that'll kill us all. And I'm not even a tree-hugger, but watch as I get called a communists hippie for suggesting moderation  and non-suicidal practices in business.	2	true	8

Innovation is encouraged when there's money to be made, and people who fight for it know that they might be the leaders in the next big thing and thus are likely to be rich if they can find a solution.  On the other, a rich company now that's invested in the way things are could push to stifle innovation that hurts their business by either buying them out and crushing it or lobbying to stop it under whatever pretense they can such as attempting to penalise the use of solar installations of customers of a coal-burning electric company.

However, (knew that was coming) in my humble view the â€˜Freeâ€™ market is mostly myth. Even in your 'Freedonia', the public has to intervene to keep itself safe from the â€“ blinders on - self-interest of the market. In addition, the examples you give of â€˜market solutionsâ€™ to public problems depend heavily â€“ especially in the beginning, but even beyond â€“ on state expenditures and incentives. No state, no computers, internet, satellites, GPS, Solar or wind research, etc. When you mentioned â€˜market solutionsâ€™ to lead in fuel you didnâ€™t get into the history of how the market resisted tooth and nail the science that leaded anything was even a problem. Very similar to what theyâ€™re doing now with Climate Change. So, maybe the market is useful when it comes to scaling up those solutions, that wouldnâ€™t exist without public intervention or support. But, I canâ€™t help eyeing them with suspicion. I know too much about their history of obfuscation, political manipulation and outright lying to protect their profits.  I view them as, at best, perhaps a necessary evil which must be watched closely and kept on a leash, lest they fuck up everything in the name of short term maximized profits and market share. At worst they benefit enormously from public largesse (at the top), while exploiting the poor and most vulnerable among us (at the bottom), and, in the middle, hollow out industrial centers in the name of fresh profits elsewhere like a swarm of locusts moving on to the next field. After which, they sell us the story of how necessary they are. Anyway, good to see you're back.	0	false	0

Social science has always been the "special" sibling in the family of science.   Yes. IQ is a social construct, as it was devised by social scientists. Don't confuse a contrived concept such as intelligence quotient with all possible forms of valid of problem solving. There is also other areas where IQ fails to include important factors.   It is just a single number that's supposed to represent the multidimensional aspects of problems solving. The fact that most rich people aren't geniuses and vice versa should highlight failings of IQ. Like how persuasive or funny you are for instance. As a model of predicting a person's success, it is lacking.	2

With unknown results. CRISPER is much better, but may not work on all organisms though. GMOs are still a new technology with incredible consequences. Science fiction doesn't help.   Nutrition is also a very, very soft science. That is one area I will admit the left has it's head up their ass. They love fad diets.

Its good enough to show if you don't have certain traits you probably won't succeed. Telling you what doesn't work isn't the same as telling you what does works. That's the probable with IQ. It's an inaccurate model.   For instance, saying cars need tires doesn't tell you what tires are best in different climates. Saying cars need fuel doesn't tell you what fuel is best in your car and which you can afford.  A 2 or 3 dimensional representation of intelligence would be better. Important details are lost using only a single number. That's my issue with IQ.	0
UgzHmKCBndOBu2KHRA94AaABAg	BlackburnBigdragon	1 day ago	1535955944877	The problem is that the fossil fuel industry owns the conservative politicians and controls all the media that the conservatives put out in the US.  The moment that global warming was mentioned in the Reagan era, the fossil fuel industry lost their minds, and pulled the exact same campaign that the Tobacco industry pulled with cigarettes years earlier.  I believe that they may have even brought in the same people to help them organize the campaign in the beginning.  And as we see today, this campaign of spreading doubt and mistrust against evidence brought forth by all the world's scientists by saying, "All the world's scientists say this.. but.. do you REALLY trust.. scientists???", and "Global warming? Look outside?  It's not that bad outside! It's the same temperature it's always been outside your house! You haven't noticed your house turning into a desert!

It's a label that's thrown around on anyone who sounds left, regardless if it has anything to do with gender or race at all. For example, when I saw someone calling another person an SJW because he or she said this film/game/book is too violent, I scratched my head asking myself "what does that has anything to do with SJW?" If a person randomly throw around snarl words (words that lost its meaning, but it's for poisoning the well), they're not making argument anymore. Anyway, both sides did that, but you're pretending it doesn't exist. It's not as absurd as people claiming that neo-Nazi doesn't exist, but still.	0

He was talking about political correctness, claiming that nobody uses the term to refer to left-leaning ideas they don't like. It's hard to agree with such an absolute statement, because somewhere there might be a lone person who uses the term like this, but I've personally never seen such a person.   Ironically the definition Enthused Norseman proposed in his initial comment has it a bit backwards. It's not that political correctness depends on non-lefties not liking something. It's based on lefties not liking something. You for example used the phrase "he or she", which some trans-activists find offensive, because it excludes non-binary people. It is therefore not politically correct.   I've personally never encountered such a phenomena among conservatives. Even when you talk to extremists they'll mostly laugh at you if you question for example their Jewish conspiracy theories.	0

That's not what American conservatives (usually) mean by that term. American conservatism doesn't just forget it's own myths just because you dismiss them. You're only going to convince those who already fundamentally reject the myth of a truly free market being the most efficient type of market. The people who fully admit that a truly unregulated market is an impossibility are called liberals, socialists, etc. (or non-Americans).  When you call China a capitalist country, I'm also a bit annoyed at the inaccuracy.  It's a hybrid of capitalism and communism.  Then there's your insistence that people who aren't centrists, that those who see fundamental problems with capitalism are "nutty" "extremists". Hey, who needs arguments and facts to dismiss claims you don't like, when you can just use dismissive language to bypass all that stuff. You suddenly seem very upbeat about the progress being made under capitalism, but the news stories I'm reading say that the prognosis is getting more and more dire.

I don't know.  Why would we then do the same when measuring the race to renewable energies?  "tell me how effective Chinese funding has been in improving green technology."  The entirety of Potholer's video does so quite succinctly, I'd venture, and there are sources in the description if you want to get more in-depth.  "tell me how effective it has been at reducing energy costs for the average chinese citizen."  So we're measuring it by money again?  "tell me how effective it's been at reducing air pollution and improving air quality in it's major cities."  The best source I can find for this is: https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/dte/userfiles/images/graph-1-l(1).jpg which says that, on average, air quality has improved from 1998-2013 by about 50%.  This graph: http://www.livefrombeijing.com/wp-content/uploads/images/reduction-400x256.jpg which started in 1999 and ended in 2007 says the drop was about 25%, which is pretty close, suggesting the data is at least consistent.  Now, both are from Chinese government sources, so if you want to argue their accuracy, I'm not necessarily opposed to that, but then your argument relies on a lack of data, from which you'll be hard-pressed to make any claim other than one of ignorance: we cannot measure how well the air quality in China is improving due to renewable energy sources.  "and finally, tell me what they're giving up to spend money on green energy, cause spending money doesn't happen in a vacuum. how about living conditions for the average chinese citizen? education levels? human health and disease? human rights?"  You're not allowing for the return investment to be considered here.  Just like the US space race in the 60s, China's investment into green energy is improving their economic stability itself, leading to new sectors for employment and new education avenues.  The idea that investment into growing industries must come at a cost to living conditions is absolutely flawed, and the proliferation of which is a large reason why the US has begun failing as a leader on the international stage.  Of course, I'd also argue that living conditions, etc. in China were already quite low in quality and funding, so there was not much funding to be taken from there in the first place.	0

It's gotten us where we are today (whether you like where we are or not) and so a conservative, in general, will prefer to "stay on the path." American conservatism and the right-wing generally support business interest, but no longer for the reason of "staying on the path." the right wants to push for ever greater GDP, even if that GDP is consolidated into fewer hands. they believe the path to accelerating GDP is to give massive corporations top priority on all issues. So this is the main different between conservatism and the economic right. A conservative could easily support a communist system if it were the status quo, whereas the right is fundamentally opposed to communism. A liberal isn't the opposite of a conservative, either. Political positions are very hard to define within single words.   but yes, the republican party has become a shill of its former self (pun intended.) and to be clear, i disagree with both conservatism and the right. but i wanted to clarify the distinction.	2

But, for most people in the real world, they want a society where they, their families, their their communities, and their countries are free, fair, prosperous, and safe. They mostly just have different ideas about how to achieve those things, and through civilized debates & democratic politics, many countries have managed to pool their thinking to achieve outstandingly better societies in the past few hundred years.

While I agree with him in one thing: Right now, the cost of such an endeavor for the primary parts of our roadways is insanely counter-productive.  But he has a number of flaws in his video, let me try and break some of them down...  The $300 back in the 2014 video for the cost of a panel... The tech was more expensive to use than that 10 years ago, and we are trying to drive down the cost by mass production of it, so to say long term it will always be 300 per tile glass, is probably a bit dishonest. Second, his whole thing about glass only seems to be a bit beyond what they are doing about experimenting the best way to do this, there are other options.   Another thing: his dishonest approach to the heating of snow to ice. Sure, it takes that much energy, but it scales with you needing more if it is really, really cold and below freezing, to just about freezing. Also, that is still less for heating than you think, and it isn't even needing to be on all the time for that, just when snow is present on the road, or ice. Power banks can easily compensate for this - and that also might, under highly efficient solar panels that can come out - to be enough to easily do the job and provide extra power, for some areas in the northern areas. Or backups from other areas where there isn't as much snow...  As for parking lots? He says in the daytime, they are almost always full of cars... Except - unless you are talking about really full parking lots, most of them, that simply isn't true in - especially around places where I live, where it wouldn't be the case.  Anyway, in conclusion, he tries to make it far sillier than it actually is, make fun of it - and draw a bunch of false dichotomies from time to time. I didn't watch the last 10 minutes or so of video, but that was what I got from it.  Though still, I do agree - right now, making it for all the roadways, would just bankrupt us for little gain. But to say there is never a place for the technology, and the potential for the price to become slowly more sane in the longer term for this (hence, the funds mainly going into parking lots) - is pretty disingenuous.	1

It doesnâ€™t' and probably never will.  Solar panels donâ€™t work when covered with dirt, so a road surface is a bad application.  Then there are safety considerations â€” how do you make a solar roadway surface that transmits light but provides acceptable traction?  Wheeled vehicles donâ€™t do too well on an icy surface.  Two examples that Thunderf00t used were â€˜standardâ€™ solar panels as a roof over parking areas, and using them to roof over the median between a dual carriageway which can then be used by cyclists.

What you do not seem to know is that there's a good reason why pollution was so profitable, it was because the state itself decided that it was more valuable for the public to let factories pollute rather than allowing victims of polluters to get reparations from the polluters.  You are right that in a free society, people establish private property rights and include provisions to protect against pollution, what you do not realize is that it's precisely government violating those property rights that prevented pollution from being handled properly in the past.  https://mises.org/system/tdf/Environmentalism%20and%20Economic%20Freedom%20The%20Case%20for%20Private%20Property%20Rights_2.pdf?file=1&type=document  What you are suggesting is a government "solution" to a government created problem of non-respect of property rights, and you are merely complaining about tragedy of the commons issue, which occur when people have the right to use a resource but do not have the right to exclude other people from using the same resource.	1	false	0

In a free market, governments do not control interest rates to postpone the effects of inflation. There's no American imperialist empire, there's no petrodollars and hundreds of aircraft carriers and military bases. Infrastructure building and repair wouldn't be the responsibility of the State, so there wouldn't have been a massive effort to pave roads and build freeways across the country, something which massively contributed to exponentially-rising carbon emissions.

(Government regulation is a classic example of market failure: if I invest a lot of time in researching and campaigning for good regulations, then I experience few of the benefits and a lot of costs.) However, with global warming, there are a few low-resolution regulations/taxes/subsidies that would be relatively transparent and not too prone to public choice problems, e.g. a VERY simple carbon tax system.

A business obviously want as little liability as possible, preferably none and would want to pay no taxes if possible, and reputation matters nothing to (for example) a coal power plant who causes someone to die of cancer 100miles away a decade after the plant was shut down, and it would be folly to assume the average person has time to be well informed, most people are too busy working. Externalities morally justify alot of taxes and regulation, so does public education insuring a literate workforce and expensive core science that the market would never get done, but that nonetheless open of avenues of huge profit. Much of the bad regulation is a result of perverse incentives from money in politics.	1

UgxB8wW4fykS9ppyALR4AaABAg	Brendan Joseph	1 day ago	1535955956156	+potholer54 You arenâ€™t wholly dismissive of the arguments for a socialist economic system just because of the few of us who use climate change as an excuse to dismantle/replace capitalism, do you?  Equating using socialism as a solution to certain societal problems (climate change only being one of the many problems) to â€˜going back to living in cavesâ€™ would be a bit ill-informed. Democracy, innovation, and freedom can all exist under a socialist system, not just a free-market system.  Yes, using climate change as an excuse to attack capitalism would be a bit ill-based, and stupid, I might add. However, this is not a reason to dismiss the many arguments and reasonings that we bring to the table to replace capitalism as a system.	40	true	10

Or, really, "Conservatives can act in favor of this in a conservative way, and here are some basic ways how."  Also, possibly: "You're letting China out-capitalist you.

								UgxB8wW4fykS9ppyALR4AaABAg.8khl3ZYXwB-8ki1KJTPJQo	Brendan Joseph	1 day ago	1535955957073	Leafsdude - First, letâ€™s define socialism: Socialism is the abolition of the private means of production and the ownership thereof (things like factories, land that is used for crop growth, etc). Remember, capitalism can not exist without the protection of the state. Which also means that just because the state regulates a certain capitalist service/aspect of the free market does not entail socialism.   Also, as much as I agree that socialism is not synonymous to communism, you must understand that communism only comes about after decades of successful socialism. There has yet to be any full communist society on Earth.   Now, the biggest point I would like to address: police, military and other public works are not socialism. Countries use militaryâ€™s to defend their own national interests, and police to enforce the laws of the land. Capitalist or socialist , both institute some form of police and military. They are both necessary to keep a nation stable and safe, to some extent. Now, moving on to other such public works, like hospitals, road repair, etc. These are forms of socialization, not socialism in its fullest terms. Socialization would essentially just be something we socialists call social democracy, or the implementation of social programs (betterment of public schooling, insuring a nations citizens with viable healthcare, housing, etc.) under a capitalist system.  Overall, no, socialism is not the government interfering with be free market. Feel free to post a bit more or ask questions, always happy to answer.	3

That is the definition of communism, not socialism.  The definition of socialism, per Merriam-Webster is "any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods".  Socialism does not mean the abolition of ownership.  So, one again, stop confusing communism with socialism.  They are not synonyms.  PS. Can you cite one example of socialism leading to communism?  Because I can practically guarantee you that I can name more examples of communism leading to socialism.	4

However, i dislike your characterization of socialists wanting to "bring us back to the stone age". In my experience thats not at all the socialist mindset. They make the point that not everything deserves the right to be a market, from slavery to sex work to the environment. These are all things that are a public concern, and all that making it a market would do is to bury the issue under various "innovations". Like, do we need to use so many resources for things that are inherintly disposable, do we even need disposable items? Again, i understand that this is from a pro-business viewpoint, but to call it conservative is to further say that the best way to conserve our society is to allow us to pillage  from our next generation.	2	false	0

"but while people on the right deny...science, people on the left deny...science" - So if your point is that "people deny science", point taken. If instead your point is to equate skepticism about nuclear power (53% of conservatives support nuclear, 34% of liberals support nuclear) with skepticism about climate science (68% of liberals believe scientists have demonstrated climate change is occurring, opposed to 18% of conservatives) then I'm forced to respectfully disagree. The issue is magnified when weighing the relative strengths of the two parties: the conservatives control the House, Senate, White House, SCOTUS, federal judiciary and over 70% of state and local governments.

He stood in Europe, and basically and incorrectly said, "We aren't worried about nuclear war, we think we can survive no matter what happens to you."

The ability to turn worthless nuclear waste, thorium, and natural uranium into vast amounts of heat and power can drive some obsessive.  Anyways if you could build them quickly despite nuclear regulations you can make about a gigawatt reactor unit like Boeing airliners.

Although as a matter of fact, wind energy for a long time was our major source of energy. It powered our boats and grainmills.  Actually, the photovoltaic effect was known for almost 200 years (although not quite as well understood back then of course as the photoelectric effect in the early 20th century). Yet it was only in the 1940's that the first somewhat decent solar panel was ever made.   Efficiency of solar panels has been improving ever since, so yes, it makes sense that you wouldn't want to convert your entire nation to solar energy if the efficiency of new panels a few years later would be much greater.  Also, there wasn't much pressure to use renewables until about half a century ago. May I remind you CFC gas regulations for example only really started cracking up in the 70s, with a more hard-line position in most countries being taken in the 80s. And even if you completely deny all anthropogenic climate change, you're still left with fossil fuel being depletable, therefore not sustainable.	2

However, the point still remains, simply because something has contributed to human prosperity at some point, or even presently, doesn't mean it should be utilized forever.  And the only way your point would be logically sound would be if that was the case.  I mean, I guess, also if we'd continued using DDT and certain forms of aerosol sprays when they were the most effective available while ignoring the ozone/environmental/w/e damage.  So, yes, if you're of the opinion bald eagles should be extinct because their deaths were caused by a tool that's useful to humanity, and that isn't obviously and directly detrimental to humanity, then at least we can say you're logically consistent.

Left unchecked, capitalism can certainly lead to harmful, destructive behaviors and government policies. But, thatâ€™s has little to do with capitalism itself, and more to do with the particular culture, norms and point-of-view of the society that embraces it. There are countries that, for example, are social democracies, which embrace aspects of capitalism, but with a much greater emphasis on individual assistance and well-being than capitalist nations like the United States.  By no means am I a capitalist (as many Americans think of it, anyway), and the United States is out of control, but the advantages of capitalism and its potential to drive innovation and progress shouldnâ€™t be ignored, or denied.	18
								UgyGd93deLRrLRQa7lZ4AaABAg.8khjJIWGpNj8khoJoOb6Cy	idontcare80	1 day ago	1535955962594	Shadow X - The problem is that capitalism always ends up unchecked, or, at the very least, without sufficient regulation. The people who are rewarded with wealth in a capitalistic economic system usually earn their wealth by taking part in things which are harmful to human prosperity (slavery, war, excessive resource consumption, etc), and they use their wealth to tear down regulations and laws which prevent them from accumulating even greater amounts of wealth.   Capitalism inherently drives the destruction of human societies, in other words. It serves a purpose in the initial advancement of human societies, but it quickly becomes obsolete.   I can think of many ways in which capitalism impedes advancement and innovation, we can do better.	15

Even if climate change didnâ€™t wipe out humanity for thousands of years, I care about humanity and would like us to stick around awhile. Humans are contributing to drastic climate change, and left unchecked, this could certainly cause humanity to become extinct. Whether that takes 100 years, or thousands, is irrelevant.  Humans are contributing to climate change that could potentially lead to our extinction. This is a fact. To ignore that, or say itâ€™s not relevant just because it may not happen for a very long time, is irresponsible and extremely selfish.	26

However I believe a truly free market that benefits all who participate in it requires constant oversight and regulation from a body independent of a profit motive aka the government. Unregulated capitalism leads to absolute monopolies which in my opinion are as big or even bigger problem than they were during the Teddy Roosevelt trust busting era, but that's a whole other issue. I believe capitalism is the way forward for the foreseeable future as long as it is properly regulated and arenas such as medicine and criminal justice are insulated from it.	6

A plutocracy, being a government that is controlled by a select few, in the case of a plutocracy, these would be the wealthy elite. To an extent, this is basically how the United States is governed. You need to understand that capitalism has nothing to do with a society being cavalier with their policies or only favoring small interest groups at the expense of all other citizens.  Denmark, for example, is a social democracy. Their economy is market driven. So capitalism is, by no means, shunned. However, they have chosen to temper a market driven economy with policies that assist people in need and try to make sure all people are represented and treated fairly.  I definitely understand your frustration (again, I am am not a capitalist), but making blanket assumptions that capitalism is always bad, and always leads to the suffering of the masses, is simply not accurate.	3

As for Nuclear fusion, It's not inevitable. Sure we've had controlled fusion for 0.3 seconds but at its peak it's only ever produced 70% output (instantaneous 0.7% total), that means it required 1.43 times as much energy put in as energy extracted. There's no guarantee we can stably make it over-unity. We've only had the plasma contained for 6.5 minutes without fusion. It looks likely ITER will get us there but it's no certainty.	3

Even Fukushima was build in the 60s on now primitive designs, though its failure was not based primarily on design flaws.  Modern nuclear plants are significantly safer than any of them, and someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but disasters from even 1980s-based designs are pretty much non-existent.  The fear of nuclear power plant disasters is largely irrational, built up by heavy media coverage of the very rare extreme incidents, and not based on any statistical data.	9

The problem is that our conservatives are aynrandian kool-aid drinkers who don't believe in any kind of regulation or intervention. And when they're not busy denying inconvenient science, they deny inconvenient economics such as the existence of market failures, negative externalities, information assymetry, etc. (all problems that REQUIRE some kind of govt intervention to resolve).

								UgxNYJqdUdOFAdH7DO94AaABAg.8khiyUVdkoi8khzaU9GP49	Phelan	1 day ago	1535955961995	I'd argue that the core problem is the "American Dream". Too many people sincerely believe that someday, they just might become filthy stinking rich - but they don't see that to be that rich (no matter the current value of the currency, whether 1 million is "rich" or 100 billion, it's about purchasing power) means that others will be poor because of them. Anyone can in theory live a "rich" life - but not everyone. If you should know Star Trek: Deep Space 9, one of the Ferengi (Rom) said it best - "We don't want to stop the exploitation, we want to become the exploiters." That is the "American Dream" in it's essence and full consequence. So a lot of people work with the assumption that they might sooner or later become rich, so they "plan ahead" and do a lot to "protect" (or support or howevery ou want to call it) rich people, thinking they'll be one of them at some point. Stop raising kids to think they can "become whatever they want, no limits", because they will adopt exactly this problematic attitude to some degree or another, consciously or subconsciously, and act accordingly by supporting those extremists.	21

I also know they were wrong. But they were writing decades ago. They were good men with ideas that have shown to be false. Friedman's machinery of freedom would result in freedom for a very tiny minority, other than in the respect that everyone is free to become the oppressor if they are able. It is a philosophy so old that it is encrusted with the blood of centuries. These were people writing from the unrealistic position of people who had never experienced the true results of pure capitalism and also had the advantage of being far smarter than the average person, so had little worry about being a victim of the society they proposed.   While their ideas MIGHT work with a world such as Heinlein envisioned of constant expansion to new worlds, it fails on one planet, unless we accept that certain people can live lives of immense wealth with little or no obligation to the society that made it possible while most people suffer. But, as long as you don't bring Jesus into this mess I can respectfully disagree with you. If you claim to be a Christian, you are a hypocrite.	9

I think that all Americans do dream of being rich someday, but I do not believe that many take that seriously. But they do see it almost as a right to have their own home, their family, and a steady job that they can work for 35 years and then retire. The modern economy demands more than that.

WHen they need the government they change their tune every time, and we don't have unregulated capitalism (and that's including regulation and legislation).  We have very entrenched crony capitalism and they aren't going to give up their power, so both sides put people out that sing a lot but either push legislation that never gets any votes or gets watered down to be symbolism.  If we had agreement that it existed and that we wanted a solution that was market based, that'd be a hell o f a lot further than where we are now.  I maintain that just b/c people say something doesn't mean they truly believe it and even if all that was absent, getting politicians who carried it through and could form voting blocks that could get through the house and the senate isn't going to happen.	0

The term itself appears to have been borrowed from Chinese Maoist groups that DID punish people for saying "politically incorrect" things (like critizising the regime), and from then on it's pretty much always been a rhetorical attack on leftists, implying that left-leaning parties have less tolerance for dissent, and also propagate a culture where people only say certain things because they want to rise in the ranks or be liked, not because they believe it. When right-wingers do the same things, they're mostly glossed as "patriotic" or "maintaining traditional values" or somesuch term, even if it just as much about maintaining "correctness" as elsewhere.	30

I'm not snubbing your offer (I'm not Potholer and have no right to anyway!) but rather suggesting that you be bold and try it on your own volition - you never know you might get 100 views, 1,000 views, 10,000 views later on then 100,000 views a couple of years from now. All by producing one video per month. The right time, the right place - be there. :) No popular Youtube content creator sprung up overnight - they grew over time. They were all too busy, too unimportant but had something they passionately wanted to put out there and that's where you're at. That's where they were all at a few years ago. Maybe it's all for nought, but maybe it's not. Just have a go.	1
								UgwLhOD5AI2S_IPcs0V4AaABAg.8khiG7UmL2b8kkBPOfT8bu	We say no to pay to win	10 hours ago	1536006367125	+MrHappyBollox erm potholers a journalist and science correspondent not a researcher, and the stuff he excluded, no hate on potholer, was quite a major reason why China invests in climate change technology, also other economical reason why investing in renewables is a good idea and the emphasis he put on others, no mention of bingo and engos (although could be in the next one), these are just from the top of my head and not watching the video again. Seen as I have access to some acedemic journals he may not, I can help him out in that way as well. There are also other things I know he was unaware of, from his previous videos and talks he's had with other YouTubers, unless he has learnt them since then. I don't have this information you speak of, if you have his email I'll gladly take it. So either I can't spell sentences that well known word all univeristies test you on, or maybe it was a typo, which is pretty obvious when I can spell sustainability and a myriad of other words in those messages. So just to get you straight people learning this at university know nothing more than this YouTube videos depth of knowledge, but at the same time I'd pretend to be at university to claim I had more knowledge? You are either jealous, which I doubt or in an odd place at the moment, which is why I am bemused, why you would be so passionate against someone offering help.	2

Why make a post that obligates Potholer to actually ask you for your information? Just give your fucking information and let him decide if he wants to reply or not. He does occasionally reply, especially if the person commenting is actually worth speaking to. But instead of doing that, you sit there saying "Here, I have something you might or might not be interested in. Ask me for it and I'll give it to you."  No. Leave your info. Don't leave a post begging for likes, and if you are going to do that, LEAVE THE FUCKING INFO AT THE SAME TIME, DUMMY.	0

He "should" know better, but his opinion isn't only depending on knowledge but also on how it influences him, how much it demands of him to change or give up... and climate change demands a lot of sacrifice to be still avoided or minimalized.	15

When I used to call myself a climate change skeptic, I did so because (1) I had done next to zero research on the topic, but (2) most of the people I admired expressed skepticism about it. There were all these articles coming from right-wingers and even MSM sites like Forbes saying "now the scientists are saying its global cooling! Whoa!" I was confused but too lazy to research it. Now that I have, though, I get it. Denying the effect humans are having on avg global temperatures via CO2 is akin to denying evolution. Every talking point - it's the sun, it's the orbit, the real problem is pollution, the climate always changes, etc. - is just pathetic contrarianism at best, and intentional disinformation at worst. The only area where debate is needed is on solutions, which I think the Right could make some good points on.	30

As the video implies, environmental damage affects EVERYONE. This obviously clashes harshly with their "do no harm" principle. It also curtails freedom and personal liberty for everyone involved. Being a left-libertarian myself, it seems to me that environmental protections should take TOP priority for anyone calling themselves a libertarian, either left or right, because there is no greater danger to liberty than a toxic planet.	6

								UgxC84-mY7sfYz38z4Z4AaABAg.8khhxufchER8khkuoQqZh8	Q B	1 day ago	1535955967152	Okay, there is a lot to address in this video that is full of crap. 1. China produces twice as much renewable power as the US, but has almost 4 times the people. You conveniently left that part out when praising them.  2. Solar and wind power combined produce a paltry 0.4% of total global energy, as per the Energy Information Administration. That is not a "revolution". Solar and wind power have both been in use for at least 100 years, given that windmills are centuries old and that the photoelectric effect was discovered in the early 1900s. Why do they still produce such shit amounts of power?  3. Solar and wind power already receive more in subsidies per unit of power produced than fossil fuels, by far. I oppose all subsidies, but spouting the "but fossil fuels get subsidies too" garbage is just economically illiterate and/or dishonest. Furthermore, you keep talking about how you want to prove that market enterprise is your preferred path to solving the alleged problem of climate change, but then you spout such cronyist nonsense like giving even more taxpayer handouts to solar and wind? Defeats the purpose of the video.  4. Trying to compare using wind power to power a country to building a railroad is idiotic. Building a railroad is not physically impossible. All of the world's batteries would store enough energy to power the US for less than a minutes. Using all of the world's lithium wouldn't even get us to 5.  5. Germany gets less than 10% of their total energy from solar and wind. Please show me one place where these things work.	0
